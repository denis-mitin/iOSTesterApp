She was the second child born to Arcadius and Eudoxia. Her older sister was Flaccilla, who was born in 397 but is assumed to have died young. Her younger siblings were Arcadia, born in 400, Theodosius II, the future emperor, and Marina, both born in 401.[1] When her father Arcadius died in 408, her brother Theodosius II was made Emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire, at seven years old. On July 4, 414 a fifteen-year-old Pulcheria proclaimed herself regent over her brother, then thirteen years of age, and made herself Augusta and Empress of the Eastern Roman Empire. According to the ancient historian Sozomen, in his Ecclesiastical History, Pulcheria took a vow of virginity when she became Augusta, and her sisters followed suit. Theodosius II died on July 26, 450, and Pulcheria soon married Marcian on November 25, 450. Marcian and Pulcheria were proclaimed Emperor and Empress of the Eastern Roman Empire. Three years later, in July 453, Pulcheria died; she was later made a saint by the Church.[2] Pulcheria is known to have held a significant amount of power in her brothers reign as emperor. Pulcheria was also of great influence over the church and theological practices of this time. She had influence over anti-pagan policies, church building projects, and the debate over the Marian title Theotokos (Birth-giver to God).Contents  [hide] 1 Biography1.1 Early life1.2 The Emperors Guardian1.3 Vow of virginity1.4 Augusta1.5 Empress1.5.1 Church conflict1.6 Death2 Relationship with Aelia Eudocia3 Influence over the church4 See also5 Notes6 ReferencesBiography[edit]Early life[edit]Pulcheria was born into the royal House of Theodosius, a dynasty of the later Roman empire, ruling in Constantinople. Her father was Arcadius, and her mother was Aelia Eudoxia. Like Pulcheria, her mother was also powerful and of great influence over the church, however not in the same way Pulcheria was. Arcadius reign was marked by the conflict between his wife and the Bishop of Constantinople,“Although his reign (Arcadius) was short, it is remembered in part for the controversial conflicts Eudoxia encountered with John Chrysostom, bishop of Constantinople from 398 to 404.[3] According to the ancient historian Sozomen, in his Ecclesiastical History, Sozomen claims that much of the rivalry was based on an ornate statue made in the honor of Eudoxia which Chrysostom condemned, “The silver statue of the empress...was placed upon a column of porphyry; and the event was celebrated by loud acclamations, dancing, games, and other manifestations of public rejoicing...John declared that these proceedings reflected dishonor on the church.”[4] According to Sozomen, John had also condemned the empress for her grandiose style of ruling over the empire and condemned her in the church, this of course enraged the empress and John was immediately disposed of. Later in life, Pulcheria would bring back the remains of John Chrysostom and make them into relics for the church, in gratitude for his pious life.[5] Eudoxia died in 404 and the emperor Arcadius died in 408. The emperor left behind four young children, including a seven-year-old Theodosius II. Theodosius was made emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire in 408, immediately after his father died. Two praetorian prefects were selected as regents over Theodosius, one being Anthemius and the other, Antiochus; both took over as regent. Eventually Pulcheria herself would take over as regent for her brother.The Emperors Guardian[edit]Once Pulcheria came of age, at fifteen, she felt, like her brother, that her family had no need for Antiochus any longer; her brother dismissed him of his duties. She then became her own brother’s regent: “In 412 Pulcheria quarreled with Antiochus, who like Anthemius had served the dynasty faithfully for a number of years, and induced her brother to dismiss him from the duties of praepositus. She then took personal charge of the imperial family, directing its affairs with such authority that she became known in society at large as the emperor’s guardian.”[6] Immediately when Pulcheria took authority over the imperial palace, the palace took on a much more monastic tone compared to that of her mother’s palace. Sozomen describes Pulcheria’s and her sisters pious ways in his Ecclesiastical History: “They all pursue the same mode of life; they are sedulous in their attendance in the house of prayer, and evince great charity towards strangers and the poor...and pass their days and their nights together in singing the praises of God.”[7] Rituals within the imperial palace also included chanting and reciting passages in the scripture, and fasting twice a week.[6] The sisters were known to have given up luxurious jewelry and apparel worn by most women of the imperial court of the past. Pulcheria also took on the role of providing all the training necessary for Theodosius to become a successful emperor, once he came of age. Although the empire was technically to be ruled by Theodosius II when he would come of age, his older sister Pulcheria exercised such profound influence over him all his life that she must be considered the co-regent of the empire until her death in 453. In fact it can be said without exaggeration that Pulcheria gave the identity to her brothers reign.[8] Pulcherias training of Theodosius included, ...how an Emperor must walk, and ride his horse, alone or in procession; how he should sit upon his throne: how to wear his Imperial armor and robes; and how to speak with dignity. By no means must he yield to loud laughter...[9] Not only did Pulcheria train her brother on the duties and customs of becoming an Emperor, but she also made sure Theodosius was trained to be a pious Christian leader. Once Theodosius came of age to rule as sole Emperor, according to many historians, the teachings of his sister had been ignored. “He was by nature kind, affable, easily led...Not only was he foolishly kind; he was careless, and often he was to neglect his duty in the administration of his Empire.”[10] This lack of power that Theodosius exemplified led to Pulcheria taking on a much larger role of authority and influence in the Empire.Vow of virginity[edit]At the same time Pulcheria proclaimed herself as guardian over her brother she also took a vow of virginity, and her sisters did as well. Pulcheria’s reason for a vow of virginity may have been her deeply religious virtue as recorded by Sozomen: “She devoted her virginity to God, and instructed her sisters to do likewise. To avoid cause of scandal and opportunities for intrigue, she permitted no man to enter her palace. In confirmation of her resolution she took God, the priests, and all the subjects of the Roman empire as witnesses...”[11] Another contemporary of Pulcheria had also described her deep piety. In a letter from Pope Leo I to Pulcheria, he compliments her on her deeply religious ways: In it you clearly show how much you love the Catholic faith and how much you despise the errors of heretics.[12] Along with being deeply pious, it is possible that Pulcheria may have had other motives to take a vow of virginity. According to ancient historians Sozomen, Socrates, and Theodoret, Pulcheria had a deep dislike for Anthemius, the former guardian of Theodosius;[13] the reasons may have been his distaste for her immense power within the empire and her unwillingness to allow Anthemius to gain power amongst the imperial court. A more recent historian, Kenneth Holum, states that Anthemius had tried to make family ties between himself and the imperial family: “Married long since and many years Pulcheria’s senior, Anthemis naturally proposed a descendent or close relative, a grandson perhaps...born a few years earlier than Pulcheria and an excellent prospect for her hand”[14] Pulcheria had found herself in a position where she would have to give her power up to her potential husband, for once a woman in the imperial court married her power was to be relinquished to her husband. In order for Pulcheria to keep her power within the imperial court she took a vow of virginity to ensure that another man could not share her power.Augusta[edit]In 414 the Roman senate made Pulcheria Augusta. During her time as Augusta, Pulcheria held a great deal of power in politics and although she was a woman was treated equally among other men of power. In the senate of Constantinople lay a bust in her honor along with the other Augusti.[15] Many important events occurred during her time as Augusta and her brothers reign as emperor; however, Pulcheria’s influence was mostly in the church. Pulcheria and her brother were known to have harbored anti Jewish sentiment, and both had started to enact laws against Jewish worship in the city of Constantinople. Before the reign of Theodosius II, synagogues were seen as private property and were protected by the imperial government. In Theodosius’s reign he enacted a law that forbade the construction of synagogues, and demanded the destruction of synagogues as well. Pulcheria and Theodosius also ordered that a group of Jews be killed after strife amongst Christians emerged in Palestine.[16] It was well known that Pulcheria had little respect for Jewish people, stemmed by her disapproval of Nestorian theological practices; Kenneth Holum writes “Pulcheria had long nursed a special hatred for Jews, and the Nestorian heresy, which appeared to contemporaries to be of Jewish origin; no doubt had served to confirm that hatred.”[17] Although Pulcheria was known to have strong feelings against pagans and Jews alike, she was known for her philanthropic spirit as well. She had built many churches in and around the city of Constantinople, she had also built many buildings for the poor in the city Sozomen writes that it would take too much time to describe all the churches Pulcheria built, as well as hospitals and inns for the poor.[18] Pulcherias building projects were so vast in Constantinople that a whole district was named in her honor called the Pulcherianai, Some of these establishments were extensive enough to give the names of their proprietors to entire quarters of the city such as the Marina quarter in the second region and the Pulcherianai in the eleventh.[19] As well as contributing to the city with new churches and districts, Pulcheria contributed significantly to the church by bringing back bishops or remains of bishops who had once been dismissed as relics to the church. Pope Leo I describes Pulcherias contributions to the church in a letter to her, ...the entire Roman Church is most grateful to you for all the works of your faith, whether having assisted envoys in every way with devoted affection and for having brought back the Catholic bishops who were ejected from their churches by an unjust sentence, or for having brought back with fitting honor to the church he governed so well the remains of Flavian of holy memory, an innocent and Catholic bishop.[20] Pulcherias time as Augusta was also marked with war and ongoing conflict with Persia. Pulcheria had inspired war against Persia when Persian King Yazdegerd I executed a Christian bishop who destroyed an Zoroastrian altar.[21] Under the influence of Pulcheria, Theodosius sent troops into battle against Persia, the fanaticism over the war by the people of the empire was described by Sozomen as ready to do anything for the sake of Christianity.[21] Pulcheria and Theodosius were victorious in their invasion of Persia, and according to historians Theodosius had credited his sisters vow of virginity as the reason for victory. Surviving letters identify the source of that victory through the vows of his sisters. In his view, when Pulcheria devoted her virginity to God and imposed the same vow on her sisters, she secured Gods favor, causing every threat and war raised against her brother to disperse spontaneously.[22] Theodosius had made his sisters virginity a tool of war propaganda, and because of her vow to be faithful only to God the hand of God would help Roman troops in battle against Persia. Pulcherias power would become even greater after the death of her brother Theodosius II.Aelia Pulcheria (January 19, 398 or 399 – 453) was the daughter of Eastern Roman Emperor Arcadius and Empress Aelia Eudoxia.

Pulcherias power would become even greater after the death of her brother Theodosius II.Aelia Pulcheria (January 19, 398 or 399 – 453) was the daughter of Eastern Roman Emperor Arcadius and Empress Aelia Eudoxia. She was the second child born to Arcadius and Eudoxia. Her older sister was Flaccilla, who was born in 397 but is assumed to have died young. Her younger siblings were Arcadia, born in 400, Theodosius II, the future emperor, and Marina, both born in 401.[1] When her father Arcadius died in 408, her brother Theodosius II was made Emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire, at seven years old. On July 4, 414 a fifteen-year-old Pulcheria proclaimed herself regent over her brother, then thirteen years of age, and made herself Augusta and Empress of the Eastern Roman Empire. According to the ancient historian Sozomen, in his Ecclesiastical History, Pulcheria took a vow of virginity when she became Augusta, and her sisters followed suit. Theodosius II died on July 26, 450, and Pulcheria soon married Marcian on November 25, 450. Marcian and Pulcheria were proclaimed Emperor and Empress of the Eastern Roman Empire. Three years later, in July 453, Pulcheria died; she was later made a saint by the Church.[2] Pulcheria is known to have held a significant amount of power in her brothers reign as emperor. Pulcheria was also of great influence over the church and theological practices of this time. She had influence over anti-pagan policies, church building projects, and the debate over the Marian title Theotokos (Birth-giver to God).Contents  [hide] 1 Biography1.1 Early life1.2 The Emperors Guardian1.3 Vow of virginity1.4 Augusta1.5 Empress1.5.1 Church conflict1.6 Death2 Relationship with Aelia Eudocia3 Influence over the church4 See also5 Notes6 ReferencesBiography[edit]Early life[edit]Pulcheria was born into the royal House of Theodosius, a dynasty of the later Roman empire, ruling in Constantinople. Her father was Arcadius, and her mother was Aelia Eudoxia. Like Pulcheria, her mother was also powerful and of great influence over the church, however not in the same way Pulcheria was. Arcadius reign was marked by the conflict between his wife and the Bishop of Constantinople,“Although his reign (Arcadius) was short, it is remembered in part for the controversial conflicts Eudoxia encountered with John Chrysostom, bishop of Constantinople from 398 to 404.[3] According to the ancient historian Sozomen, in his Ecclesiastical History, Sozomen claims that much of the rivalry was based on an ornate statue made in the honor of Eudoxia which Chrysostom condemned, “The silver statue of the empress...was placed upon a column of porphyry; and the event was celebrated by loud acclamations, dancing, games, and other manifestations of public rejoicing...John declared that these proceedings reflected dishonor on the church.”[4] According to Sozomen, John had also condemned the empress for her grandiose style of ruling over the empire and condemned her in the church, this of course enraged the empress and John was immediately disposed of. Later in life, Pulcheria would bring back the remains of John Chrysostom and make them into relics for the church, in gratitude for his pious life.[5] Eudoxia died in 404 and the emperor Arcadius died in 408. The emperor left behind four young children, including a seven-year-old Theodosius II. Theodosius was made emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire in 408, immediately after his father died. Two praetorian prefects were selected as regents over Theodosius, one being Anthemius and the other, Antiochus; both took over as regent. Eventually Pulcheria herself would take over as regent for her brother.The Emperors Guardian[edit]Once Pulcheria came of age, at fifteen, she felt, like her brother, that her family had no need for Antiochus any longer; her brother dismissed him of his duties. She then became her own brother’s regent: “In 412 Pulcheria quarreled with Antiochus, who like Anthemius had served the dynasty faithfully for a number of years, and induced her brother to dismiss him from the duties of praepositus. She then took personal charge of the imperial family, directing its affairs with such authority that she became known in society at large as the emperor’s guardian.”[6] Immediately when Pulcheria took authority over the imperial palace, the palace took on a much more monastic tone compared to that of her mother’s palace. Sozomen describes Pulcheria’s and her sisters pious ways in his Ecclesiastical History: “They all pursue the same mode of life; they are sedulous in their attendance in the house of prayer, and evince great charity towards strangers and the poor...and pass their days and their nights together in singing the praises of God.”[7] Rituals within the imperial palace also included chanting and reciting passages in the scripture, and fasting twice a week.[6] The sisters were known to have given up luxurious jewelry and apparel worn by most women of the imperial court of the past. Pulcheria also took on the role of providing all the training necessary for Theodosius to become a successful emperor, once he came of age. Although the empire was technically to be ruled by Theodosius II when he would come of age, his older sister Pulcheria exercised such profound influence over him all his life that she must be considered the co-regent of the empire until her death in 453. In fact it can be said without exaggeration that Pulcheria gave the identity to her brothers reign.[8] Pulcherias training of Theodosius included, ...how an Emperor must walk, and ride his horse, alone or in procession; how he should sit upon his throne: how to wear his Imperial armor and robes; and how to speak with dignity. By no means must he yield to loud laughter...[9] Not only did Pulcheria train her brother on the duties and customs of becoming an Emperor, but she also made sure Theodosius was trained to be a pious Christian leader. Once Theodosius came of age to rule as sole Emperor, according to many historians, the teachings of his sister had been ignored. “He was by nature kind, affable, easily led...Not only was he foolishly kind; he was careless, and often he was to neglect his duty in the administration of his Empire.”[10] This lack of power that Theodosius exemplified led to Pulcheria taking on a much larger role of authority and influence in the Empire.Vow of virginity[edit]At the same time Pulcheria proclaimed herself as guardian over her brother she also took a vow of virginity, and her sisters did as well. Pulcheria’s reason for a vow of virginity may have been her deeply religious virtue as recorded by Sozomen: “She devoted her virginity to God, and instructed her sisters to do likewise. To avoid cause of scandal and opportunities for intrigue, she permitted no man to enter her palace. In confirmation of her resolution she took God, the priests, and all the subjects of the Roman empire as witnesses...”[11] Another contemporary of Pulcheria had also described her deep piety. In a letter from Pope Leo I to Pulcheria, he compliments her on her deeply religious ways: In it you clearly show how much you love the Catholic faith and how much you despise the errors of heretics.[12] Along with being deeply pious, it is possible that Pulcheria may have had other motives to take a vow of virginity. According to ancient historians Sozomen, Socrates, and Theodoret, Pulcheria had a deep dislike for Anthemius, the former guardian of Theodosius;[13] the reasons may have been his distaste for her immense power within the empire and her unwillingness to allow Anthemius to gain power amongst the imperial court. A more recent historian, Kenneth Holum, states that Anthemius had tried to make family ties between himself and the imperial family: “Married long since and many years Pulcheria’s senior, Anthemis naturally proposed a descendent or close relative, a grandson perhaps...born a few years earlier than Pulcheria and an excellent prospect for her hand”[14] Pulcheria had found herself in a position where she would have to give her power up to her potential husband, for once a woman in the imperial court married her power was to be relinquished to her husband. In order for Pulcheria to keep her power within the imperial court she took a vow of virginity to ensure that another man could not share her power.Augusta[edit]In 414 the Roman senate made Pulcheria Augusta. During her time as Augusta, Pulcheria held a great deal of power in politics and although she was a woman was treated equally among other men of power. In the senate of Constantinople lay a bust in her honor along with the other Augusti.[15] Many important events occurred during her time as Augusta and her brothers reign as emperor; however, Pulcheria’s influence was mostly in the church. Pulcheria and her brother were known to have harbored anti Jewish sentiment, and both had started to enact laws against Jewish worship in the city of Constantinople. Before the reign of Theodosius II, synagogues were seen as private property and were protected by the imperial government. In Theodosius’s reign he enacted a law that forbade the construction of synagogues, and demanded the destruction of synagogues as well. Pulcheria and Theodosius also ordered that a group of Jews be killed after strife amongst Christians emerged in Palestine.[16] It was well known that Pulcheria had little respect for Jewish people, stemmed by her disapproval of Nestorian theological practices; Kenneth Holum writes “Pulcheria had long nursed a special hatred for Jews, and the Nestorian heresy, which appeared to contemporaries to be of Jewish origin; no doubt had served to confirm that hatred.”[17] Although Pulcheria was known to have strong feelings against pagans and Jews alike, she was known for her philanthropic spirit as well. She had built many churches in and around the city of Constantinople, she had also built many buildings for the poor in the city Sozomen writes that it would take too much time to describe all the churches Pulcheria built, as well as hospitals and inns for the poor.[18] Pulcherias building projects were so vast in Constantinople that a whole district was named in her honor called the Pulcherianai, Some of these establishments were extensive enough to give the names of their proprietors to entire quarters of the city such as the Marina quarter in the second region and the Pulcherianai in the eleventh.[19] As well as contributing to the city with new churches and districts, Pulcheria contributed significantly to the church by bringing back bishops or remains of bishops who had once been dismissed as relics to the church. Pope Leo I describes Pulcherias contributions to the church in a letter to her, ...the entire Roman Church is most grateful to you for all the works of your faith, whether having assisted envoys in every way with devoted affection and for having brought back the Catholic bishops who were ejected from their churches by an unjust sentence, or for having brought back with fitting honor to the church he governed so well the remains of Flavian of holy memory, an innocent and Catholic bishop.[20] Pulcherias time as Augusta was also marked with war and ongoing conflict with Persia. Pulcheria had inspired war against Persia when Persian King Yazdegerd I executed a Christian bishop who destroyed an Zoroastrian altar.[21] Under the influence of Pulcheria, Theodosius sent troops into battle against Persia, the fanaticism over the war by the people of the empire was described by Sozomen as ready to do anything for the sake of Christianity.[21] Pulcheria and Theodosius were victorious in their invasion of Persia, and according to historians Theodosius had credited his sisters vow of virginity as the reason for victory. Surviving letters identify the source of that victory through the vows of his sisters. In his view, when Pulcheria devoted her virginity to God and imposed the same vow on her sisters, she secured Gods favor, causing every threat and war raised against her brother to disperse spontaneously.[22] Theodosius had made his sisters virginity a tool of war propaganda, and because of her vow to be faithful only to God the hand of God would help Roman troops in battle against Persia.

In his view, when Pulcheria devoted her virginity to God and imposed the same vow on her sisters, she secured Gods favor, causing every threat and war raised against her brother to disperse spontaneously.[22] Theodosius had made his sisters virginity a tool of war propaganda, and because of her vow to be faithful only to God the hand of God would help Roman troops in battle against Persia. Pulcherias power would become even greater after the death of her brother Theodosius II.Aelia Pulcheria (January 19, 398 or 399 – 453) was the daughter of Eastern Roman Emperor Arcadius and Empress Aelia Eudoxia. She was the second child born to Arcadius and Eudoxia. Her older sister was Flaccilla, who was born in 397 but is assumed to have died young. Her younger siblings were Arcadia, born in 400, Theodosius II, the future emperor, and Marina, both born in 401.[1] When her father Arcadius died in 408, her brother Theodosius II was made Emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire, at seven years old. On July 4, 414 a fifteen-year-old Pulcheria proclaimed herself regent over her brother, then thirteen years of age, and made herself Augusta and Empress of the Eastern Roman Empire. According to the ancient historian Sozomen, in his Ecclesiastical History, Pulcheria took a vow of virginity when she became Augusta, and her sisters followed suit. Theodosius II died on July 26, 450, and Pulcheria soon married Marcian on November 25, 450. Marcian and Pulcheria were proclaimed Emperor and Empress of the Eastern Roman Empire. Three years later, in July 453, Pulcheria died; she was later made a saint by the Church.[2] Pulcheria is known to have held a significant amount of power in her brothers reign as emperor. Pulcheria was also of great influence over the church and theological practices of this time. She had influence over anti-pagan policies, church building projects, and the debate over the Marian title Theotokos (Birth-giver to God).Contents  [hide] 1 Biography1.1 Early life1.2 The Emperors Guardian1.3 Vow of virginity1.4 Augusta1.5 Empress1.5.1 Church conflict1.6 Death2 Relationship with Aelia Eudocia3 Influence over the church4 See also5 Notes6 ReferencesBiography[edit]Early life[edit]Pulcheria was born into the royal House of Theodosius, a dynasty of the later Roman empire, ruling in Constantinople. Her father was Arcadius, and her mother was Aelia Eudoxia. Like Pulcheria, her mother was also powerful and of great influence over the church, however not in the same way Pulcheria was. Arcadius reign was marked by the conflict between his wife and the Bishop of Constantinople,“Although his reign (Arcadius) was short, it is remembered in part for the controversial conflicts Eudoxia encountered with John Chrysostom, bishop of Constantinople from 398 to 404.[3] According to the ancient historian Sozomen, in his Ecclesiastical History, Sozomen claims that much of the rivalry was based on an ornate statue made in the honor of Eudoxia which Chrysostom condemned, “The silver statue of the empress...was placed upon a column of porphyry; and the event was celebrated by loud acclamations, dancing, games, and other manifestations of public rejoicing...John declared that these proceedings reflected dishonor on the church.”[4] According to Sozomen, John had also condemned the empress for her grandiose style of ruling over the empire and condemned her in the church, this of course enraged the empress and John was immediately disposed of. Later in life, Pulcheria would bring back the remains of John Chrysostom and make them into relics for the church, in gratitude for his pious life.[5] Eudoxia died in 404 and the emperor Arcadius died in 408. The emperor left behind four young children, including a seven-year-old Theodosius II. Theodosius was made emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire in 408, immediately after his father died. Two praetorian prefects were selected as regents over Theodosius, one being Anthemius and the other, Antiochus; both took over as regent. Eventually Pulcheria herself would take over as regent for her brother.The Emperors Guardian[edit]Once Pulcheria came of age, at fifteen, she felt, like her brother, that her family had no need for Antiochus any longer; her brother dismissed him of his duties. She then became her own brother’s regent: “In 412 Pulcheria quarreled with Antiochus, who like Anthemius had served the dynasty faithfully for a number of years, and induced her brother to dismiss him from the duties of praepositus. She then took personal charge of the imperial family, directing its affairs with such authority that she became known in society at large as the emperor’s guardian.”[6] Immediately when Pulcheria took authority over the imperial palace, the palace took on a much more monastic tone compared to that of her mother’s palace. Sozomen describes Pulcheria’s and her sisters pious ways in his Ecclesiastical History: “They all pursue the same mode of life; they are sedulous in their attendance in the house of prayer, and evince great charity towards strangers and the poor...and pass their days and their nights together in singing the praises of God.”[7] Rituals within the imperial palace also included chanting and reciting passages in the scripture, and fasting twice a week.[6] The sisters were known to have given up luxurious jewelry and apparel worn by most women of the imperial court of the past. Pulcheria also took on the role of providing all the training necessary for Theodosius to become a successful emperor, once he came of age. Although the empire was technically to be ruled by Theodosius II when he would come of age, his older sister Pulcheria exercised such profound influence over him all his life that she must be considered the co-regent of the empire until her death in 453. In fact it can be said without exaggeration that Pulcheria gave the identity to her brothers reign.[8] Pulcherias training of Theodosius included, ...how an Emperor must walk, and ride his horse, alone or in procession; how he should sit upon his throne: how to wear his Imperial armor and robes; and how to speak with dignity. By no means must he yield to loud laughter...[9] Not only did Pulcheria train her brother on the duties and customs of becoming an Emperor, but she also made sure Theodosius was trained to be a pious Christian leader. Once Theodosius came of age to rule as sole Emperor, according to many historians, the teachings of his sister had been ignored. “He was by nature kind, affable, easily led...Not only was he foolishly kind; he was careless, and often he was to neglect his duty in the administration of his Empire.”[10] This lack of power that Theodosius exemplified led to Pulcheria taking on a much larger role of authority and influence in the Empire.Vow of virginity[edit]At the same time Pulcheria proclaimed herself as guardian over her brother she also took a vow of virginity, and her sisters did as well. Pulcheria’s reason for a vow of virginity may have been her deeply religious virtue as recorded by Sozomen: “She devoted her virginity to God, and instructed her sisters to do likewise. To avoid cause of scandal and opportunities for intrigue, she permitted no man to enter her palace. In confirmation of her resolution she took God, the priests, and all the subjects of the Roman empire as witnesses...”[11] Another contemporary of Pulcheria had also described her deep piety. In a letter from Pope Leo I to Pulcheria, he compliments her on her deeply religious ways: In it you clearly show how much you love the Catholic faith and how much you despise the errors of heretics.[12] Along with being deeply pious, it is possible that Pulcheria may have had other motives to take a vow of virginity. According to ancient historians Sozomen, Socrates, and Theodoret, Pulcheria had a deep dislike for Anthemius, the former guardian of Theodosius;[13] the reasons may have been his distaste for her immense power within the empire and her unwillingness to allow Anthemius to gain power amongst the imperial court. A more recent historian, Kenneth Holum, states that Anthemius had tried to make family ties between himself and the imperial family: “Married long since and many years Pulcheria’s senior, Anthemis naturally proposed a descendent or close relative, a grandson perhaps...born a few years earlier than Pulcheria and an excellent prospect for her hand”[14] Pulcheria had found herself in a position where she would have to give her power up to her potential husband, for once a woman in the imperial court married her power was to be relinquished to her husband. In order for Pulcheria to keep her power within the imperial court she took a vow of virginity to ensure that another man could not share her power.Augusta[edit]In 414 the Roman senate made Pulcheria Augusta. During her time as Augusta, Pulcheria held a great deal of power in politics and although she was a woman was treated equally among other men of power. In the senate of Constantinople lay a bust in her honor along with the other Augusti.[15] Many important events occurred during her time as Augusta and her brothers reign as emperor; however, Pulcheria’s influence was mostly in the church. Pulcheria and her brother were known to have harbored anti Jewish sentiment, and both had started to enact laws against Jewish worship in the city of Constantinople. Before the reign of Theodosius II, synagogues were seen as private property and were protected by the imperial government. In Theodosius’s reign he enacted a law that forbade the construction of synagogues, and demanded the destruction of synagogues as well. Pulcheria and Theodosius also ordered that a group of Jews be killed after strife amongst Christians emerged in Palestine.[16] It was well known that Pulcheria had little respect for Jewish people, stemmed by her disapproval of Nestorian theological practices; Kenneth Holum writes “Pulcheria had long nursed a special hatred for Jews, and the Nestorian heresy, which appeared to contemporaries to be of Jewish origin; no doubt had served to confirm that hatred.”[17] Although Pulcheria was known to have strong feelings against pagans and Jews alike, she was known for her philanthropic spirit as well. She had built many churches in and around the city of Constantinople, she had also built many buildings for the poor in the city Sozomen writes that it would take too much time to describe all the churches Pulcheria built, as well as hospitals and inns for the poor.[18] Pulcherias building projects were so vast in Constantinople that a whole district was named in her honor called the Pulcherianai, Some of these establishments were extensive enough to give the names of their proprietors to entire quarters of the city such as the Marina quarter in the second region and the Pulcherianai in the eleventh.[19] As well as contributing to the city with new churches and districts, Pulcheria contributed significantly to the church by bringing back bishops or remains of bishops who had once been dismissed as relics to the church. Pope Leo I describes Pulcherias contributions to the church in a letter to her, ...the entire Roman Church is most grateful to you for all the works of your faith, whether having assisted envoys in every way with devoted affection and for having brought back the Catholic bishops who were ejected from their churches by an unjust sentence, or for having brought back with fitting honor to the church he governed so well the remains of Flavian of holy memory, an innocent and Catholic bishop.[20] Pulcherias time as Augusta was also marked with war and ongoing conflict with Persia. Pulcheria had inspired war against Persia when Persian King Yazdegerd I executed a Christian bishop who destroyed an Zoroastrian altar.[21] Under the influence of Pulcheria, Theodosius sent troops into battle against Persia, the fanaticism over the war by the people of the empire was described by Sozomen as ready to do anything for the sake of Christianity.[21] Pulcheria and Theodosius were victorious in their invasion of Persia, and according to historians Theodosius had credited his sisters vow of virginity as the reason for victory.

Pulcheria had inspired war against Persia when Persian King Yazdegerd I executed a Christian bishop who destroyed an Zoroastrian altar.[21] Under the influence of Pulcheria, Theodosius sent troops into battle against Persia, the fanaticism over the war by the people of the empire was described by Sozomen as ready to do anything for the sake of Christianity.[21] Pulcheria and Theodosius were victorious in their invasion of Persia, and according to historians Theodosius had credited his sisters vow of virginity as the reason for victory. Surviving letters identify the source of that victory through the vows of his sisters. In his view, when Pulcheria devoted her virginity to God and imposed the same vow on her sisters, she secured Gods favor, causing every threat and war raised against her brother to disperse spontaneously.[22] Theodosius had made his sisters virginity a tool of war propaganda, and because of her vow to be faithful only to God the hand of God would help Roman troops in battle against Persia. Pulcherias power would become even greater after the death of her brother Theodosius II.Aelia Pulcheria (January 19, 398 or 399 – 453) was the daughter of Eastern Roman Emperor Arcadius and Empress Aelia Eudoxia. She was the second child born to Arcadius and Eudoxia. Her older sister was Flaccilla, who was born in 397 but is assumed to have died young. Her younger siblings were Arcadia, born in 400, Theodosius II, the future emperor, and Marina, both born in 401.[1] When her father Arcadius died in 408, her brother Theodosius II was made Emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire, at seven years old. On July 4, 414 a fifteen-year-old Pulcheria proclaimed herself regent over her brother, then thirteen years of age, and made herself Augusta and Empress of the Eastern Roman Empire. According to the ancient historian Sozomen, in his Ecclesiastical History, Pulcheria took a vow of virginity when she became Augusta, and her sisters followed suit. Theodosius II died on July 26, 450, and Pulcheria soon married Marcian on November 25, 450. Marcian and Pulcheria were proclaimed Emperor and Empress of the Eastern Roman Empire. Three years later, in July 453, Pulcheria died; she was later made a saint by the Church.[2] Pulcheria is known to have held a significant amount of power in her brothers reign as emperor. Pulcheria was also of great influence over the church and theological practices of this time. She had influence over anti-pagan policies, church building projects, and the debate over the Marian title Theotokos (Birth-giver to God).Contents  [hide] 1 Biography1.1 Early life1.2 The Emperors Guardian1.3 Vow of virginity1.4 Augusta1.5 Empress1.5.1 Church conflict1.6 Death2 Relationship with Aelia Eudocia3 Influence over the church4 See also5 Notes6 ReferencesBiography[edit]Early life[edit]Pulcheria was born into the royal House of Theodosius, a dynasty of the later Roman empire, ruling in Constantinople. Her father was Arcadius, and her mother was Aelia Eudoxia. Like Pulcheria, her mother was also powerful and of great influence over the church, however not in the same way Pulcheria was. Arcadius reign was marked by the conflict between his wife and the Bishop of Constantinople,“Although his reign (Arcadius) was short, it is remembered in part for the controversial conflicts Eudoxia encountered with John Chrysostom, bishop of Constantinople from 398 to 404.[3] According to the ancient historian Sozomen, in his Ecclesiastical History, Sozomen claims that much of the rivalry was based on an ornate statue made in the honor of Eudoxia which Chrysostom condemned, “The silver statue of the empress...was placed upon a column of porphyry; and the event was celebrated by loud acclamations, dancing, games, and other manifestations of public rejoicing...John declared that these proceedings reflected dishonor on the church.”[4] According to Sozomen, John had also condemned the empress for her grandiose style of ruling over the empire and condemned her in the church, this of course enraged the empress and John was immediately disposed of. Later in life, Pulcheria would bring back the remains of John Chrysostom and make them into relics for the church, in gratitude for his pious life.[5] Eudoxia died in 404 and the emperor Arcadius died in 408. The emperor left behind four young children, including a seven-year-old Theodosius II. Theodosius was made emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire in 408, immediately after his father died. Two praetorian prefects were selected as regents over Theodosius, one being Anthemius and the other, Antiochus; both took over as regent. Eventually Pulcheria herself would take over as regent for her brother.The Emperors Guardian[edit]Once Pulcheria came of age, at fifteen, she felt, like her brother, that her family had no need for Antiochus any longer; her brother dismissed him of his duties. She then became her own brother’s regent: “In 412 Pulcheria quarreled with Antiochus, who like Anthemius had served the dynasty faithfully for a number of years, and induced her brother to dismiss him from the duties of praepositus. She then took personal charge of the imperial family, directing its affairs with such authority that she became known in society at large as the emperor’s guardian.”[6] Immediately when Pulcheria took authority over the imperial palace, the palace took on a much more monastic tone compared to that of her mother’s palace. Sozomen describes Pulcheria’s and her sisters pious ways in his Ecclesiastical History: “They all pursue the same mode of life; they are sedulous in their attendance in the house of prayer, and evince great charity towards strangers and the poor...and pass their days and their nights together in singing the praises of God.”[7] Rituals within the imperial palace also included chanting and reciting passages in the scripture, and fasting twice a week.[6] The sisters were known to have given up luxurious jewelry and apparel worn by most women of the imperial court of the past. Pulcheria also took on the role of providing all the training necessary for Theodosius to become a successful emperor, once he came of age. Although the empire was technically to be ruled by Theodosius II when he would come of age, his older sister Pulcheria exercised such profound influence over him all his life that she must be considered the co-regent of the empire until her death in 453. In fact it can be said without exaggeration that Pulcheria gave the identity to her brothers reign.[8] Pulcherias training of Theodosius included, ...how an Emperor must walk, and ride his horse, alone or in procession; how he should sit upon his throne: how to wear his Imperial armor and robes; and how to speak with dignity. By no means must he yield to loud laughter...[9] Not only did Pulcheria train her brother on the duties and customs of becoming an Emperor, but she also made sure Theodosius was trained to be a pious Christian leader. Once Theodosius came of age to rule as sole Emperor, according to many historians, the teachings of his sister had been ignored. “He was by nature kind, affable, easily led...Not only was he foolishly kind; he was careless, and often he was to neglect his duty in the administration of his Empire.”[10] This lack of power that Theodosius exemplified led to Pulcheria taking on a much larger role of authority and influence in the Empire.Vow of virginity[edit]At the same time Pulcheria proclaimed herself as guardian over her brother she also took a vow of virginity, and her sisters did as well. Pulcheria’s reason for a vow of virginity may have been her deeply religious virtue as recorded by Sozomen: “She devoted her virginity to God, and instructed her sisters to do likewise. To avoid cause of scandal and opportunities for intrigue, she permitted no man to enter her palace. In confirmation of her resolution she took God, the priests, and all the subjects of the Roman empire as witnesses...”[11] Another contemporary of Pulcheria had also described her deep piety. In a letter from Pope Leo I to Pulcheria, he compliments her on her deeply religious ways: In it you clearly show how much you love the Catholic faith and how much you despise the errors of heretics.[12] Along with being deeply pious, it is possible that Pulcheria may have had other motives to take a vow of virginity. According to ancient historians Sozomen, Socrates, and Theodoret, Pulcheria had a deep dislike for Anthemius, the former guardian of Theodosius;[13] the reasons may have been his distaste for her immense power within the empire and her unwillingness to allow Anthemius to gain power amongst the imperial court. A more recent historian, Kenneth Holum, states that Anthemius had tried to make family ties between himself and the imperial family: “Married long since and many years Pulcheria’s senior, Anthemis naturally proposed a descendent or close relative, a grandson perhaps...born a few years earlier than Pulcheria and an excellent prospect for her hand”[14] Pulcheria had found herself in a position where she would have to give her power up to her potential husband, for once a woman in the imperial court married her power was to be relinquished to her husband. In order for Pulcheria to keep her power within the imperial court she took a vow of virginity to ensure that another man could not share her power.Augusta[edit]In 414 the Roman senate made Pulcheria Augusta. During her time as Augusta, Pulcheria held a great deal of power in politics and although she was a woman was treated equally among other men of power. In the senate of Constantinople lay a bust in her honor along with the other Augusti.[15] Many important events occurred during her time as Augusta and her brothers reign as emperor; however, Pulcheria’s influence was mostly in the church. Pulcheria and her brother were known to have harbored anti Jewish sentiment, and both had started to enact laws against Jewish worship in the city of Constantinople. Before the reign of Theodosius II, synagogues were seen as private property and were protected by the imperial government. In Theodosius’s reign he enacted a law that forbade the construction of synagogues, and demanded the destruction of synagogues as well. Pulcheria and Theodosius also ordered that a group of Jews be killed after strife amongst Christians emerged in Palestine.[16] It was well known that Pulcheria had little respect for Jewish people, stemmed by her disapproval of Nestorian theological practices; Kenneth Holum writes “Pulcheria had long nursed a special hatred for Jews, and the Nestorian heresy, which appeared to contemporaries to be of Jewish origin; no doubt had served to confirm that hatred.”[17] Although Pulcheria was known to have strong feelings against pagans and Jews alike, she was known for her philanthropic spirit as well. She had built many churches in and around the city of Constantinople, she had also built many buildings for the poor in the city Sozomen writes that it would take too much time to describe all the churches Pulcheria built, as well as hospitals and inns for the poor.[18] Pulcherias building projects were so vast in Constantinople that a whole district was named in her honor called the Pulcherianai, Some of these establishments were extensive enough to give the names of their proprietors to entire quarters of the city such as the Marina quarter in the second region and the Pulcherianai in the eleventh.[19] As well as contributing to the city with new churches and districts, Pulcheria contributed significantly to the church by bringing back bishops or remains of bishops who had once been dismissed as relics to the church.

She had built many churches in and around the city of Constantinople, she had also built many buildings for the poor in the city Sozomen writes that it would take too much time to describe all the churches Pulcheria built, as well as hospitals and inns for the poor.[18] Pulcherias building projects were so vast in Constantinople that a whole district was named in her honor called the Pulcherianai, Some of these establishments were extensive enough to give the names of their proprietors to entire quarters of the city such as the Marina quarter in the second region and the Pulcherianai in the eleventh.[19] As well as contributing to the city with new churches and districts, Pulcheria contributed significantly to the church by bringing back bishops or remains of bishops who had once been dismissed as relics to the church. Pope Leo I describes Pulcherias contributions to the church in a letter to her, ...the entire Roman Church is most grateful to you for all the works of your faith, whether having assisted envoys in every way with devoted affection and for having brought back the Catholic bishops who were ejected from their churches by an unjust sentence, or for having brought back with fitting honor to the church he governed so well the remains of Flavian of holy memory, an innocent and Catholic bishop.[20] Pulcherias time as Augusta was also marked with war and ongoing conflict with Persia. Pulcheria had inspired war against Persia when Persian King Yazdegerd I executed a Christian bishop who destroyed an Zoroastrian altar.[21] Under the influence of Pulcheria, Theodosius sent troops into battle against Persia, the fanaticism over the war by the people of the empire was described by Sozomen as ready to do anything for the sake of Christianity.[21] Pulcheria and Theodosius were victorious in their invasion of Persia, and according to historians Theodosius had credited his sisters vow of virginity as the reason for victory. Surviving letters identify the source of that victory through the vows of his sisters. In his view, when Pulcheria devoted her virginity to God and imposed the same vow on her sisters, she secured Gods favor, causing every threat and war raised against her brother to disperse spontaneously.[22] Theodosius had made his sisters virginity a tool of war propaganda, and because of her vow to be faithful only to God the hand of God would help Roman troops in battle against Persia. Pulcherias power would become even greater after the death of her brother Theodosius II.Aelia Pulcheria (January 19, 398 or 399 – 453) was the daughter of Eastern Roman Emperor Arcadius and Empress Aelia Eudoxia. She was the second child born to Arcadius and Eudoxia. Her older sister was Flaccilla, who was born in 397 but is assumed to have died young. Her younger siblings were Arcadia, born in 400, Theodosius II, the future emperor, and Marina, both born in 401.[1] When her father Arcadius died in 408, her brother Theodosius II was made Emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire, at seven years old. On July 4, 414 a fifteen-year-old Pulcheria proclaimed herself regent over her brother, then thirteen years of age, and made herself Augusta and Empress of the Eastern Roman Empire. According to the ancient historian Sozomen, in his Ecclesiastical History, Pulcheria took a vow of virginity when she became Augusta, and her sisters followed suit. Theodosius II died on July 26, 450, and Pulcheria soon married Marcian on November 25, 450. Marcian and Pulcheria were proclaimed Emperor and Empress of the Eastern Roman Empire. Three years later, in July 453, Pulcheria died; she was later made a saint by the Church.[2] Pulcheria is known to have held a significant amount of power in her brothers reign as emperor. Pulcheria was also of great influence over the church and theological practices of this time. She had influence over anti-pagan policies, church building projects, and the debate over the Marian title Theotokos (Birth-giver to God).Contents  [hide] 1 Biography1.1 Early life1.2 The Emperors Guardian1.3 Vow of virginity1.4 Augusta1.5 Empress1.5.1 Church conflict1.6 Death2 Relationship with Aelia Eudocia3 Influence over the church4 See also5 Notes6 ReferencesBiography[edit]Early life[edit]Pulcheria was born into the royal House of Theodosius, a dynasty of the later Roman empire, ruling in Constantinople. Her father was Arcadius, and her mother was Aelia Eudoxia. Like Pulcheria, her mother was also powerful and of great influence over the church, however not in the same way Pulcheria was. Arcadius reign was marked by the conflict between his wife and the Bishop of Constantinople,“Although his reign (Arcadius) was short, it is remembered in part for the controversial conflicts Eudoxia encountered with John Chrysostom, bishop of Constantinople from 398 to 404.[3] According to the ancient historian Sozomen, in his Ecclesiastical History, Sozomen claims that much of the rivalry was based on an ornate statue made in the honor of Eudoxia which Chrysostom condemned, “The silver statue of the empress...was placed upon a column of porphyry; and the event was celebrated by loud acclamations, dancing, games, and other manifestations of public rejoicing...John declared that these proceedings reflected dishonor on the church.”[4] According to Sozomen, John had also condemned the empress for her grandiose style of ruling over the empire and condemned her in the church, this of course enraged the empress and John was immediately disposed of. Later in life, Pulcheria would bring back the remains of John Chrysostom and make them into relics for the church, in gratitude for his pious life.[5] Eudoxia died in 404 and the emperor Arcadius died in 408. The emperor left behind four young children, including a seven-year-old Theodosius II. Theodosius was made emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire in 408, immediately after his father died. Two praetorian prefects were selected as regents over Theodosius, one being Anthemius and the other, Antiochus; both took over as regent. Eventually Pulcheria herself would take over as regent for her brother.The Emperors Guardian[edit]Once Pulcheria came of age, at fifteen, she felt, like her brother, that her family had no need for Antiochus any longer; her brother dismissed him of his duties. She then became her own brother’s regent: “In 412 Pulcheria quarreled with Antiochus, who like Anthemius had served the dynasty faithfully for a number of years, and induced her brother to dismiss him from the duties of praepositus. She then took personal charge of the imperial family, directing its affairs with such authority that she became known in society at large as the emperor’s guardian.”[6] Immediately when Pulcheria took authority over the imperial palace, the palace took on a much more monastic tone compared to that of her mother’s palace. Sozomen describes Pulcheria’s and her sisters pious ways in his Ecclesiastical History: “They all pursue the same mode of life; they are sedulous in their attendance in the house of prayer, and evince great charity towards strangers and the poor...and pass their days and their nights together in singing the praises of God.”[7] Rituals within the imperial palace also included chanting and reciting passages in the scripture, and fasting twice a week.[6] The sisters were known to have given up luxurious jewelry and apparel worn by most women of the imperial court of the past. Pulcheria also took on the role of providing all the training necessary for Theodosius to become a successful emperor, once he came of age. Although the empire was technically to be ruled by Theodosius II when he would come of age, his older sister Pulcheria exercised such profound influence over him all his life that she must be considered the co-regent of the empire until her death in 453. In fact it can be said without exaggeration that Pulcheria gave the identity to her brothers reign.[8] Pulcherias training of Theodosius included, ...how an Emperor must walk, and ride his horse, alone or in procession; how he should sit upon his throne: how to wear his Imperial armor and robes; and how to speak with dignity. By no means must he yield to loud laughter...[9] Not only did Pulcheria train her brother on the duties and customs of becoming an Emperor, but she also made sure Theodosius was trained to be a pious Christian leader. Once Theodosius came of age to rule as sole Emperor, according to many historians, the teachings of his sister had been ignored. “He was by nature kind, affable, easily led...Not only was he foolishly kind; he was careless, and often he was to neglect his duty in the administration of his Empire.”[10] This lack of power that Theodosius exemplified led to Pulcheria taking on a much larger role of authority and influence in the Empire.Vow of virginity[edit]At the same time Pulcheria proclaimed herself as guardian over her brother she also took a vow of virginity, and her sisters did as well. Pulcheria’s reason for a vow of virginity may have been her deeply religious virtue as recorded by Sozomen: “She devoted her virginity to God, and instructed her sisters to do likewise. To avoid cause of scandal and opportunities for intrigue, she permitted no man to enter her palace. In confirmation of her resolution she took God, the priests, and all the subjects of the Roman empire as witnesses...”[11] Another contemporary of Pulcheria had also described her deep piety. In a letter from Pope Leo I to Pulcheria, he compliments her on her deeply religious ways: In it you clearly show how much you love the Catholic faith and how much you despise the errors of heretics.[12] Along with being deeply pious, it is possible that Pulcheria may have had other motives to take a vow of virginity. According to ancient historians Sozomen, Socrates, and Theodoret, Pulcheria had a deep dislike for Anthemius, the former guardian of Theodosius;[13] the reasons may have been his distaste for her immense power within the empire and her unwillingness to allow Anthemius to gain power amongst the imperial court. A more recent historian, Kenneth Holum, states that Anthemius had tried to make family ties between himself and the imperial family: “Married long since and many years Pulcheria’s senior, Anthemis naturally proposed a descendent or close relative, a grandson perhaps...born a few years earlier than Pulcheria and an excellent prospect for her hand”[14] Pulcheria had found herself in a position where she would have to give her power up to her potential husband, for once a woman in the imperial court married her power was to be relinquished to her husband. In order for Pulcheria to keep her power within the imperial court she took a vow of virginity to ensure that another man could not share her power.Augusta[edit]In 414 the Roman senate made Pulcheria Augusta. During her time as Augusta, Pulcheria held a great deal of power in politics and although she was a woman was treated equally among other men of power. In the senate of Constantinople lay a bust in her honor along with the other Augusti.[15] Many important events occurred during her time as Augusta and her brothers reign as emperor; however, Pulcheria’s influence was mostly in the church. Pulcheria and her brother were known to have harbored anti Jewish sentiment, and both had started to enact laws against Jewish worship in the city of Constantinople. Before the reign of Theodosius II, synagogues were seen as private property and were protected by the imperial government. In Theodosius’s reign he enacted a law that forbade the construction of synagogues, and demanded the destruction of synagogues as well.

Pulcheria and Theodosius also ordered that a group of Jews be killed after strife amongst Christians emerged in Palestine.[16] It was well known that Pulcheria had little respect for Jewish people, stemmed by her disapproval of Nestorian theological practices; Kenneth Holum writes “Pulcheria had long nursed a special hatred for Jews, and the Nestorian heresy, which appeared to contemporaries to be of Jewish origin; no doubt had served to confirm that hatred.”[17] Although Pulcheria was known to have strong feelings against pagans and Jews alike, she was known for her philanthropic spirit as well. She had built many churches in and around the city of Constantinople, she had also built many buildings for the poor in the city Sozomen writes that it would take too much time to describe all the churches Pulcheria built, as well as hospitals and inns for the poor.[18] Pulcherias building projects were so vast in Constantinople that a whole district was named in her honor called the Pulcherianai, Some of these establishments were extensive enough to give the names of their proprietors to entire quarters of the city such as the Marina quarter in the second region and the Pulcherianai in the eleventh.[19] As well as contributing to the city with new churches and districts, Pulcheria contributed significantly to the church by bringing back bishops or remains of bishops who had once been dismissed as relics to the church. Pope Leo I describes Pulcherias contributions to the church in a letter to her, ...the entire Roman Church is most grateful to you for all the works of your faith, whether having assisted envoys in every way with devoted affection and for having brought back the Catholic bishops who were ejected from their churches by an unjust sentence, or for having brought back with fitting honor to the church he governed so well the remains of Flavian of holy memory, an innocent and Catholic bishop.[20] Pulcherias time as Augusta was also marked with war and ongoing conflict with Persia. Pulcheria had inspired war against Persia when Persian King Yazdegerd I executed a Christian bishop who destroyed an Zoroastrian altar.[21] Under the influence of Pulcheria, Theodosius sent troops into battle against Persia, the fanaticism over the war by the people of the empire was described by Sozomen as ready to do anything for the sake of Christianity.[21] Pulcheria and Theodosius were victorious in their invasion of Persia, and according to historians Theodosius had credited his sisters vow of virginity as the reason for victory. Surviving letters identify the source of that victory through the vows of his sisters. In his view, when Pulcheria devoted her virginity to God and imposed the same vow on her sisters, she secured Gods favor, causing every threat and war raised against her brother to disperse spontaneously.[22] Theodosius had made his sisters virginity a tool of war propaganda, and because of her vow to be faithful only to God the hand of God would help Roman troops in battle against Persia. Pulcherias power would become even greater after the death of her brother Theodosius II.Aelia Pulcheria (January 19, 398 or 399 – 453) was the daughter of Eastern Roman Emperor Arcadius and Empress Aelia Eudoxia. She was the second child born to Arcadius and Eudoxia. Her older sister was Flaccilla, who was born in 397 but is assumed to have died young. Her younger siblings were Arcadia, born in 400, Theodosius II, the future emperor, and Marina, both born in 401.[1] When her father Arcadius died in 408, her brother Theodosius II was made Emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire, at seven years old. On July 4, 414 a fifteen-year-old Pulcheria proclaimed herself regent over her brother, then thirteen years of age, and made herself Augusta and Empress of the Eastern Roman Empire. According to the ancient historian Sozomen, in his Ecclesiastical History, Pulcheria took a vow of virginity when she became Augusta, and her sisters followed suit. Theodosius II died on July 26, 450, and Pulcheria soon married Marcian on November 25, 450. Marcian and Pulcheria were proclaimed Emperor and Empress of the Eastern Roman Empire. Three years later, in July 453, Pulcheria died; she was later made a saint by the Church.[2] Pulcheria is known to have held a significant amount of power in her brothers reign as emperor. Pulcheria was also of great influence over the church and theological practices of this time. She had influence over anti-pagan policies, church building projects, and the debate over the Marian title Theotokos (Birth-giver to God).Contents  [hide] 1 Biography1.1 Early life1.2 The Emperors Guardian1.3 Vow of virginity1.4 Augusta1.5 Empress1.5.1 Church conflict1.6 Death2 Relationship with Aelia Eudocia3 Influence over the church4 See also5 Notes6 ReferencesBiography[edit]Early life[edit]Pulcheria was born into the royal House of Theodosius, a dynasty of the later Roman empire, ruling in Constantinople. Her father was Arcadius, and her mother was Aelia Eudoxia. Like Pulcheria, her mother was also powerful and of great influence over the church, however not in the same way Pulcheria was. Arcadius reign was marked by the conflict between his wife and the Bishop of Constantinople,“Although his reign (Arcadius) was short, it is remembered in part for the controversial conflicts Eudoxia encountered with John Chrysostom, bishop of Constantinople from 398 to 404.[3] According to the ancient historian Sozomen, in his Ecclesiastical History, Sozomen claims that much of the rivalry was based on an ornate statue made in the honor of Eudoxia which Chrysostom condemned, “The silver statue of the empress...was placed upon a column of porphyry; and the event was celebrated by loud acclamations, dancing, games, and other manifestations of public rejoicing...John declared that these proceedings reflected dishonor on the church.”[4] According to Sozomen, John had also condemned the empress for her grandiose style of ruling over the empire and condemned her in the church, this of course enraged the empress and John was immediately disposed of. Later in life, Pulcheria would bring back the remains of John Chrysostom and make them into relics for the church, in gratitude for his pious life.[5] Eudoxia died in 404 and the emperor Arcadius died in 408. The emperor left behind four young children, including a seven-year-old Theodosius II. Theodosius was made emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire in 408, immediately after his father died. Two praetorian prefects were selected as regents over Theodosius, one being Anthemius and the other, Antiochus; both took over as regent. Eventually Pulcheria herself would take over as regent for her brother.The Emperors Guardian[edit]Once Pulcheria came of age, at fifteen, she felt, like her brother, that her family had no need for Antiochus any longer; her brother dismissed him of his duties. She then became her own brother’s regent: “In 412 Pulcheria quarreled with Antiochus, who like Anthemius had served the dynasty faithfully for a number of years, and induced her brother to dismiss him from the duties of praepositus. She then took personal charge of the imperial family, directing its affairs with such authority that she became known in society at large as the emperor’s guardian.”[6] Immediately when Pulcheria took authority over the imperial palace, the palace took on a much more monastic tone compared to that of her mother’s palace. Sozomen describes Pulcheria’s and her sisters pious ways in his Ecclesiastical History: “They all pursue the same mode of life; they are sedulous in their attendance in the house of prayer, and evince great charity towards strangers and the poor...and pass their days and their nights together in singing the praises of God.”[7] Rituals within the imperial palace also included chanting and reciting passages in the scripture, and fasting twice a week.[6] The sisters were known to have given up luxurious jewelry and apparel worn by most women of the imperial court of the past. Pulcheria also took on the role of providing all the training necessary for Theodosius to become a successful emperor, once he came of age. Although the empire was technically to be ruled by Theodosius II when he would come of age, his older sister Pulcheria exercised such profound influence over him all his life that she must be considered the co-regent of the empire until her death in 453. In fact it can be said without exaggeration that Pulcheria gave the identity to her brothers reign.[8] Pulcherias training of Theodosius included, ...how an Emperor must walk, and ride his horse, alone or in procession; how he should sit upon his throne: how to wear his Imperial armor and robes; and how to speak with dignity. By no means must he yield to loud laughter...[9] Not only did Pulcheria train her brother on the duties and customs of becoming an Emperor, but she also made sure Theodosius was trained to be a pious Christian leader. Once Theodosius came of age to rule as sole Emperor, according to many historians, the teachings of his sister had been ignored. “He was by nature kind, affable, easily led...Not only was he foolishly kind; he was careless, and often he was to neglect his duty in the administration of his Empire.”[10] This lack of power that Theodosius exemplified led to Pulcheria taking on a much larger role of authority and influence in the Empire.Vow of virginity[edit]At the same time Pulcheria proclaimed herself as guardian over her brother she also took a vow of virginity, and her sisters did as well. Pulcheria’s reason for a vow of virginity may have been her deeply religious virtue as recorded by Sozomen: “She devoted her virginity to God, and instructed her sisters to do likewise. To avoid cause of scandal and opportunities for intrigue, she permitted no man to enter her palace. In confirmation of her resolution she took God, the priests, and all the subjects of the Roman empire as witnesses...”[11] Another contemporary of Pulcheria had also described her deep piety. In a letter from Pope Leo I to Pulcheria, he compliments her on her deeply religious ways: In it you clearly show how much you love the Catholic faith and how much you despise the errors of heretics.[12] Along with being deeply pious, it is possible that Pulcheria may have had other motives to take a vow of virginity. According to ancient historians Sozomen, Socrates, and Theodoret, Pulcheria had a deep dislike for Anthemius, the former guardian of Theodosius;[13] the reasons may have been his distaste for her immense power within the empire and her unwillingness to allow Anthemius to gain power amongst the imperial court. A more recent historian, Kenneth Holum, states that Anthemius had tried to make family ties between himself and the imperial family: “Married long since and many years Pulcheria’s senior, Anthemis naturally proposed a descendent or close relative, a grandson perhaps...born a few years earlier than Pulcheria and an excellent prospect for her hand”[14] Pulcheria had found herself in a position where she would have to give her power up to her potential husband, for once a woman in the imperial court married her power was to be relinquished to her husband. In order for Pulcheria to keep her power within the imperial court she took a vow of virginity to ensure that another man could not share her power.Augusta[edit]In 414 the Roman senate made Pulcheria Augusta. During her time as Augusta, Pulcheria held a great deal of power in politics and although she was a woman was treated equally among other men of power. In the senate of Constantinople lay a bust in her honor along with the other Augusti.[15] Many important events occurred during her time as Augusta and her brothers reign as emperor; however, Pulcheria’s influence was mostly in the church. Pulcheria and her brother were known to have harbored anti Jewish sentiment, and both had started to enact laws against Jewish worship in the city of Constantinople. Before the reign of Theodosius II, synagogues were seen as private property and were protected by the imperial government. In Theodosius’s reign he enacted a law that forbade the construction of synagogues, and demanded the destruction of synagogues as well.

In Theodosius’s reign he enacted a law that forbade the construction of synagogues, and demanded the destruction of synagogues as well. Pulcheria and Theodosius also ordered that a group of Jews be killed after strife amongst Christians emerged in Palestine.[16] It was well known that Pulcheria had little respect for Jewish people, stemmed by her disapproval of Nestorian theological practices; Kenneth Holum writes “Pulcheria had long nursed a special hatred for Jews, and the Nestorian heresy, which appeared to contemporaries to be of Jewish origin; no doubt had served to confirm that hatred.”[17] Although Pulcheria was known to have strong feelings against pagans and Jews alike, she was known for her philanthropic spirit as well. She had built many churches in and around the city of Constantinople, she had also built many buildings for the poor in the city Sozomen writes that it would take too much time to describe all the churches Pulcheria built, as well as hospitals and inns for the poor.[18] Pulcherias building projects were so vast in Constantinople that a whole district was named in her honor called the Pulcherianai, Some of these establishments were extensive enough to give the names of their proprietors to entire quarters of the city such as the Marina quarter in the second region and the Pulcherianai in the eleventh.[19] As well as contributing to the city with new churches and districts, Pulcheria contributed significantly to the church by bringing back bishops or remains of bishops who had once been dismissed as relics to the church. Pope Leo I describes Pulcherias contributions to the church in a letter to her, ...the entire Roman Church is most grateful to you for all the works of your faith, whether having assisted envoys in every way with devoted affection and for having brought back the Catholic bishops who were ejected from their churches by an unjust sentence, or for having brought back with fitting honor to the church he governed so well the remains of Flavian of holy memory, an innocent and Catholic bishop.[20] Pulcherias time as Augusta was also marked with war and ongoing conflict with Persia. Pulcheria had inspired war against Persia when Persian King Yazdegerd I executed a Christian bishop who destroyed an Zoroastrian altar.[21] Under the influence of Pulcheria, Theodosius sent troops into battle against Persia, the fanaticism over the war by the people of the empire was described by Sozomen as ready to do anything for the sake of Christianity.[21] Pulcheria and Theodosius were victorious in their invasion of Persia, and according to historians Theodosius had credited his sisters vow of virginity as the reason for victory. Surviving letters identify the source of that victory through the vows of his sisters. In his view, when Pulcheria devoted her virginity to God and imposed the same vow on her sisters, she secured Gods favor, causing every threat and war raised against her brother to disperse spontaneously.[22] Theodosius had made his sisters virginity a tool of war propaganda, and because of her vow to be faithful only to God the hand of God would help Roman troops in battle against Persia. Pulcherias power would become even greater after the death of her brother Theodosius II.Aelia Pulcheria (January 19, 398 or 399 – 453) was the daughter of Eastern Roman Emperor Arcadius and Empress Aelia Eudoxia. She was the second child born to Arcadius and Eudoxia. Her older sister was Flaccilla, who was born in 397 but is assumed to have died young. Her younger siblings were Arcadia, born in 400, Theodosius II, the future emperor, and Marina, both born in 401.[1] When her father Arcadius died in 408, her brother Theodosius II was made Emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire, at seven years old. On July 4, 414 a fifteen-year-old Pulcheria proclaimed herself regent over her brother, then thirteen years of age, and made herself Augusta and Empress of the Eastern Roman Empire. According to the ancient historian Sozomen, in his Ecclesiastical History, Pulcheria took a vow of virginity when she became Augusta, and her sisters followed suit. Theodosius II died on July 26, 450, and Pulcheria soon married Marcian on November 25, 450. Marcian and Pulcheria were proclaimed Emperor and Empress of the Eastern Roman Empire. Three years later, in July 453, Pulcheria died; she was later made a saint by the Church.[2] Pulcheria is known to have held a significant amount of power in her brothers reign as emperor. Pulcheria was also of great influence over the church and theological practices of this time. She had influence over anti-pagan policies, church building projects, and the debate over the Marian title Theotokos (Birth-giver to God).Contents  [hide] 1 Biography1.1 Early life1.2 The Emperors Guardian1.3 Vow of virginity1.4 Augusta1.5 Empress1.5.1 Church conflict1.6 Death2 Relationship with Aelia Eudocia3 Influence over the church4 See also5 Notes6 ReferencesBiography[edit]Early life[edit]Pulcheria was born into the royal House of Theodosius, a dynasty of the later Roman empire, ruling in Constantinople. Her father was Arcadius, and her mother was Aelia Eudoxia. Like Pulcheria, her mother was also powerful and of great influence over the church, however not in the same way Pulcheria was. Arcadius reign was marked by the conflict between his wife and the Bishop of Constantinople,“Although his reign (Arcadius) was short, it is remembered in part for the controversial conflicts Eudoxia encountered with John Chrysostom, bishop of Constantinople from 398 to 404.[3] According to the ancient historian Sozomen, in his Ecclesiastical History, Sozomen claims that much of the rivalry was based on an ornate statue made in the honor of Eudoxia which Chrysostom condemned, “The silver statue of the empress...was placed upon a column of porphyry; and the event was celebrated by loud acclamations, dancing, games, and other manifestations of public rejoicing...John declared that these proceedings reflected dishonor on the church.”[4] According to Sozomen, John had also condemned the empress for her grandiose style of ruling over the empire and condemned her in the church, this of course enraged the empress and John was immediately disposed of. Later in life, Pulcheria would bring back the remains of John Chrysostom and make them into relics for the church, in gratitude for his pious life.[5] Eudoxia died in 404 and the emperor Arcadius died in 408. The emperor left behind four young children, including a seven-year-old Theodosius II. Theodosius was made emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire in 408, immediately after his father died. Two praetorian prefects were selected as regents over Theodosius, one being Anthemius and the other, Antiochus; both took over as regent. Eventually Pulcheria herself would take over as regent for her brother.The Emperors Guardian[edit]Once Pulcheria came of age, at fifteen, she felt, like her brother, that her family had no need for Antiochus any longer; her brother dismissed him of his duties. She then became her own brother’s regent: “In 412 Pulcheria quarreled with Antiochus, who like Anthemius had served the dynasty faithfully for a number of years, and induced her brother to dismiss him from the duties of praepositus. She then took personal charge of the imperial family, directing its affairs with such authority that she became known in society at large as the emperor’s guardian.”[6] Immediately when Pulcheria took authority over the imperial palace, the palace took on a much more monastic tone compared to that of her mother’s palace. Sozomen describes Pulcheria’s and her sisters pious ways in his Ecclesiastical History: “They all pursue the same mode of life; they are sedulous in their attendance in the house of prayer, and evince great charity towards strangers and the poor...and pass their days and their nights together in singing the praises of God.”[7] Rituals within the imperial palace also included chanting and reciting passages in the scripture, and fasting twice a week.[6] The sisters were known to have given up luxurious jewelry and apparel worn by most women of the imperial court of the past. Pulcheria also took on the role of providing all the training necessary for Theodosius to become a successful emperor, once he came of age. Although the empire was technically to be ruled by Theodosius II when he would come of age, his older sister Pulcheria exercised such profound influence over him all his life that she must be considered the co-regent of the empire until her death in 453. In fact it can be said without exaggeration that Pulcheria gave the identity to her brothers reign.[8] Pulcherias training of Theodosius included, ...how an Emperor must walk, and ride his horse, alone or in procession; how he should sit upon his throne: how to wear his Imperial armor and robes; and how to speak with dignity. By no means must he yield to loud laughter...[9] Not only did Pulcheria train her brother on the duties and customs of becoming an Emperor, but she also made sure Theodosius was trained to be a pious Christian leader. Once Theodosius came of age to rule as sole Emperor, according to many historians, the teachings of his sister had been ignored. “He was by nature kind, affable, easily led...Not only was he foolishly kind; he was careless, and often he was to neglect his duty in the administration of his Empire.”[10] This lack of power that Theodosius exemplified led to Pulcheria taking on a much larger role of authority and influence in the Empire.Vow of virginity[edit]At the same time Pulcheria proclaimed herself as guardian over her brother she also took a vow of virginity, and her sisters did as well. Pulcheria’s reason for a vow of virginity may have been her deeply religious virtue as recorded by Sozomen: “She devoted her virginity to God, and instructed her sisters to do likewise. To avoid cause of scandal and opportunities for intrigue, she permitted no man to enter her palace. In confirmation of her resolution she took God, the priests, and all the subjects of the Roman empire as witnesses...”[11] Another contemporary of Pulcheria had also described her deep piety. In a letter from Pope Leo I to Pulcheria, he compliments her on her deeply religious ways: In it you clearly show how much you love the Catholic faith and how much you despise the errors of heretics.[12] Along with being deeply pious, it is possible that Pulcheria may have had other motives to take a vow of virginity. According to ancient historians Sozomen, Socrates, and Theodoret, Pulcheria had a deep dislike for Anthemius, the former guardian of Theodosius;[13] the reasons may have been his distaste for her immense power within the empire and her unwillingness to allow Anthemius to gain power amongst the imperial court. A more recent historian, Kenneth Holum, states that Anthemius had tried to make family ties between himself and the imperial family: “Married long since and many years Pulcheria’s senior, Anthemis naturally proposed a descendent or close relative, a grandson perhaps...born a few years earlier than Pulcheria and an excellent prospect for her hand”[14] Pulcheria had found herself in a position where she would have to give her power up to her potential husband, for once a woman in the imperial court married her power was to be relinquished to her husband. In order for Pulcheria to keep her power within the imperial court she took a vow of virginity to ensure that another man could not share her power.Augusta[edit]In 414 the Roman senate made Pulcheria Augusta. During her time as Augusta, Pulcheria held a great deal of power in politics and although she was a woman was treated equally among other men of power. In the senate of Constantinople lay a bust in her honor along with the other Augusti.[15] Many important events occurred during her time as Augusta and her brothers reign as emperor; however, Pulcheria’s influence was mostly in the church. Pulcheria and her brother were known to have harbored anti Jewish sentiment, and both had started to enact laws against Jewish worship in the city of Constantinople. Before the reign of Theodosius II, synagogues were seen as private property and were protected by the imperial government.

Before the reign of Theodosius II, synagogues were seen as private property and were protected by the imperial government. In Theodosius’s reign he enacted a law that forbade the construction of synagogues, and demanded the destruction of synagogues as well. Pulcheria and Theodosius also ordered that a group of Jews be killed after strife amongst Christians emerged in Palestine.[16] It was well known that Pulcheria had little respect for Jewish people, stemmed by her disapproval of Nestorian theological practices; Kenneth Holum writes “Pulcheria had long nursed a special hatred for Jews, and the Nestorian heresy, which appeared to contemporaries to be of Jewish origin; no doubt had served to confirm that hatred.”[17] Although Pulcheria was known to have strong feelings against pagans and Jews alike, she was known for her philanthropic spirit as well. She had built many churches in and around the city of Constantinople, she had also built many buildings for the poor in the city Sozomen writes that it would take too much time to describe all the churches Pulcheria built, as well as hospitals and inns for the poor.[18] Pulcherias building projects were so vast in Constantinople that a whole district was named in her honor called the Pulcherianai, Some of these establishments were extensive enough to give the names of their proprietors to entire quarters of the city such as the Marina quarter in the second region and the Pulcherianai in the eleventh.[19] As well as contributing to the city with new churches and districts, Pulcheria contributed significantly to the church by bringing back bishops or remains of bishops who had once been dismissed as relics to the church. Pope Leo I describes Pulcherias contributions to the church in a letter to her, ...the entire Roman Church is most grateful to you for all the works of your faith, whether having assisted envoys in every way with devoted affection and for having brought back the Catholic bishops who were ejected from their churches by an unjust sentence, or for having brought back with fitting honor to the church he governed so well the remains of Flavian of holy memory, an innocent and Catholic bishop.[20] Pulcherias time as Augusta was also marked with war and ongoing conflict with Persia. Pulcheria had inspired war against Persia when Persian King Yazdegerd I executed a Christian bishop who destroyed an Zoroastrian altar.[21] Under the influence of Pulcheria, Theodosius sent troops into battle against Persia, the fanaticism over the war by the people of the empire was described by Sozomen as ready to do anything for the sake of Christianity.[21] Pulcheria and Theodosius were victorious in their invasion of Persia, and according to historians Theodosius had credited his sisters vow of virginity as the reason for victory. Surviving letters identify the source of that victory through the vows of his sisters. In his view, when Pulcheria devoted her virginity to God and imposed the same vow on her sisters, she secured Gods favor, causing every threat and war raised against her brother to disperse spontaneously.[22] Theodosius had made his sisters virginity a tool of war propaganda, and because of her vow to be faithful only to God the hand of God would help Roman troops in battle against Persia. Pulcherias power would become even greater after the death of her brother Theodosius II.Aelia Pulcheria (January 19, 398 or 399 – 453) was the daughter of Eastern Roman Emperor Arcadius and Empress Aelia Eudoxia. She was the second child born to Arcadius and Eudoxia. Her older sister was Flaccilla, who was born in 397 but is assumed to have died young. Her younger siblings were Arcadia, born in 400, Theodosius II, the future emperor, and Marina, both born in 401.[1] When her father Arcadius died in 408, her brother Theodosius II was made Emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire, at seven years old. On July 4, 414 a fifteen-year-old Pulcheria proclaimed herself regent over her brother, then thirteen years of age, and made herself Augusta and Empress of the Eastern Roman Empire. According to the ancient historian Sozomen, in his Ecclesiastical History, Pulcheria took a vow of virginity when she became Augusta, and her sisters followed suit. Theodosius II died on July 26, 450, and Pulcheria soon married Marcian on November 25, 450. Marcian and Pulcheria were proclaimed Emperor and Empress of the Eastern Roman Empire. Three years later, in July 453, Pulcheria died; she was later made a saint by the Church.[2] Pulcheria is known to have held a significant amount of power in her brothers reign as emperor. Pulcheria was also of great influence over the church and theological practices of this time. She had influence over anti-pagan policies, church building projects, and the debate over the Marian title Theotokos (Birth-giver to God).Contents  [hide] 1 Biography1.1 Early life1.2 The Emperors Guardian1.3 Vow of virginity1.4 Augusta1.5 Empress1.5.1 Church conflict1.6 Death2 Relationship with Aelia Eudocia3 Influence over the church4 See also5 Notes6 ReferencesBiography[edit]Early life[edit]Pulcheria was born into the royal House of Theodosius, a dynasty of the later Roman empire, ruling in Constantinople. Her father was Arcadius, and her mother was Aelia Eudoxia. Like Pulcheria, her mother was also powerful and of great influence over the church, however not in the same way Pulcheria was. Arcadius reign was marked by the conflict between his wife and the Bishop of Constantinople,“Although his reign (Arcadius) was short, it is remembered in part for the controversial conflicts Eudoxia encountered with John Chrysostom, bishop of Constantinople from 398 to 404.[3] According to the ancient historian Sozomen, in his Ecclesiastical History, Sozomen claims that much of the rivalry was based on an ornate statue made in the honor of Eudoxia which Chrysostom condemned, “The silver statue of the empress...was placed upon a column of porphyry; and the event was celebrated by loud acclamations, dancing, games, and other manifestations of public rejoicing...John declared that these proceedings reflected dishonor on the church.”[4] According to Sozomen, John had also condemned the empress for her grandiose style of ruling over the empire and condemned her in the church, this of course enraged the empress and John was immediately disposed of. Later in life, Pulcheria would bring back the remains of John Chrysostom and make them into relics for the church, in gratitude for his pious life.[5] Eudoxia died in 404 and the emperor Arcadius died in 408. The emperor left behind four young children, including a seven-year-old Theodosius II. Theodosius was made emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire in 408, immediately after his father died. Two praetorian prefects were selected as regents over Theodosius, one being Anthemius and the other, Antiochus; both took over as regent. Eventually Pulcheria herself would take over as regent for her brother.The Emperors Guardian[edit]Once Pulcheria came of age, at fifteen, she felt, like her brother, that her family had no need for Antiochus any longer; her brother dismissed him of his duties. She then became her own brother’s regent: “In 412 Pulcheria quarreled with Antiochus, who like Anthemius had served the dynasty faithfully for a number of years, and induced her brother to dismiss him from the duties of praepositus. She then took personal charge of the imperial family, directing its affairs with such authority that she became known in society at large as the emperor’s guardian.”[6] Immediately when Pulcheria took authority over the imperial palace, the palace took on a much more monastic tone compared to that of her mother’s palace. Sozomen describes Pulcheria’s and her sisters pious ways in his Ecclesiastical History: “They all pursue the same mode of life; they are sedulous in their attendance in the house of prayer, and evince great charity towards strangers and the poor...and pass their days and their nights together in singing the praises of God.”[7] Rituals within the imperial palace also included chanting and reciting passages in the scripture, and fasting twice a week.[6] The sisters were known to have given up luxurious jewelry and apparel worn by most women of the imperial court of the past. Pulcheria also took on the role of providing all the training necessary for Theodosius to become a successful emperor, once he came of age. Although the empire was technically to be ruled by Theodosius II when he would come of age, his older sister Pulcheria exercised such profound influence over him all his life that she must be considered the co-regent of the empire until her death in 453. In fact it can be said without exaggeration that Pulcheria gave the identity to her brothers reign.[8] Pulcherias training of Theodosius included, ...how an Emperor must walk, and ride his horse, alone or in procession; how he should sit upon his throne: how to wear his Imperial armor and robes; and how to speak with dignity. By no means must he yield to loud laughter...[9] Not only did Pulcheria train her brother on the duties and customs of becoming an Emperor, but she also made sure Theodosius was trained to be a pious Christian leader. Once Theodosius came of age to rule as sole Emperor, according to many historians, the teachings of his sister had been ignored. “He was by nature kind, affable, easily led...Not only was he foolishly kind; he was careless, and often he was to neglect his duty in the administration of his Empire.”[10] This lack of power that Theodosius exemplified led to Pulcheria taking on a much larger role of authority and influence in the Empire.Vow of virginity[edit]At the same time Pulcheria proclaimed herself as guardian over her brother she also took a vow of virginity, and her sisters did as well. Pulcheria’s reason for a vow of virginity may have been her deeply religious virtue as recorded by Sozomen: “She devoted her virginity to God, and instructed her sisters to do likewise. To avoid cause of scandal and opportunities for intrigue, she permitted no man to enter her palace. In confirmation of her resolution she took God, the priests, and all the subjects of the Roman empire as witnesses...”[11] Another contemporary of Pulcheria had also described her deep piety. In a letter from Pope Leo I to Pulcheria, he compliments her on her deeply religious ways: In it you clearly show how much you love the Catholic faith and how much you despise the errors of heretics.[12] Along with being deeply pious, it is possible that Pulcheria may have had other motives to take a vow of virginity. According to ancient historians Sozomen, Socrates, and Theodoret, Pulcheria had a deep dislike for Anthemius, the former guardian of Theodosius;[13] the reasons may have been his distaste for her immense power within the empire and her unwillingness to allow Anthemius to gain power amongst the imperial court. A more recent historian, Kenneth Holum, states that Anthemius had tried to make family ties between himself and the imperial family: “Married long since and many years Pulcheria’s senior, Anthemis naturally proposed a descendent or close relative, a grandson perhaps...born a few years earlier than Pulcheria and an excellent prospect for her hand”[14] Pulcheria had found herself in a position where she would have to give her power up to her potential husband, for once a woman in the imperial court married her power was to be relinquished to her husband. In order for Pulcheria to keep her power within the imperial court she took a vow of virginity to ensure that another man could not share her power.Augusta[edit]In 414 the Roman senate made Pulcheria Augusta. During her time as Augusta, Pulcheria held a great deal of power in politics and although she was a woman was treated equally among other men of power. In the senate of Constantinople lay a bust in her honor along with the other Augusti.[15] Many important events occurred during her time as Augusta and her brothers reign as emperor; however, Pulcheria’s influence was mostly in the church.

In the senate of Constantinople lay a bust in her honor along with the other Augusti.[15] Many important events occurred during her time as Augusta and her brothers reign as emperor; however, Pulcheria’s influence was mostly in the church. Pulcheria and her brother were known to have harbored anti Jewish sentiment, and both had started to enact laws against Jewish worship in the city of Constantinople. Before the reign of Theodosius II, synagogues were seen as private property and were protected by the imperial government. In Theodosius’s reign he enacted a law that forbade the construction of synagogues, and demanded the destruction of synagogues as well. Pulcheria and Theodosius also ordered that a group of Jews be killed after strife amongst Christians emerged in Palestine.[16] It was well known that Pulcheria had little respect for Jewish people, stemmed by her disapproval of Nestorian theological practices; Kenneth Holum writes “Pulcheria had long nursed a special hatred for Jews, and the Nestorian heresy, which appeared to contemporaries to be of Jewish origin; no doubt had served to confirm that hatred.”[17] Although Pulcheria was known to have strong feelings against pagans and Jews alike, she was known for her philanthropic spirit as well. She had built many churches in and around the city of Constantinople, she had also built many buildings for the poor in the city Sozomen writes that it would take too much time to describe all the churches Pulcheria built, as well as hospitals and inns for the poor.[18] Pulcherias building projects were so vast in Constantinople that a whole district was named in her honor called the Pulcherianai, Some of these establishments were extensive enough to give the names of their proprietors to entire quarters of the city such as the Marina quarter in the second region and the Pulcherianai in the eleventh.[19] As well as contributing to the city with new churches and districts, Pulcheria contributed significantly to the church by bringing back bishops or remains of bishops who had once been dismissed as relics to the church. Pope Leo I describes Pulcherias contributions to the church in a letter to her, ...the entire Roman Church is most grateful to you for all the works of your faith, whether having assisted envoys in every way with devoted affection and for having brought back the Catholic bishops who were ejected from their churches by an unjust sentence, or for having brought back with fitting honor to the church he governed so well the remains of Flavian of holy memory, an innocent and Catholic bishop.[20] Pulcherias time as Augusta was also marked with war and ongoing conflict with Persia. Pulcheria had inspired war against Persia when Persian King Yazdegerd I executed a Christian bishop who destroyed an Zoroastrian altar.[21] Under the influence of Pulcheria, Theodosius sent troops into battle against Persia, the fanaticism over the war by the people of the empire was described by Sozomen as ready to do anything for the sake of Christianity.[21] Pulcheria and Theodosius were victorious in their invasion of Persia, and according to historians Theodosius had credited his sisters vow of virginity as the reason for victory. Surviving letters identify the source of that victory through the vows of his sisters. In his view, when Pulcheria devoted her virginity to God and imposed the same vow on her sisters, she secured Gods favor, causing every threat and war raised against her brother to disperse spontaneously.[22] Theodosius had made his sisters virginity a tool of war propaganda, and because of her vow to be faithful only to God the hand of God would help Roman troops in battle against Persia. Pulcherias power would become even greater after the death of her brother Theodosius II.Aelia Pulcheria (January 19, 398 or 399 – 453) was the daughter of Eastern Roman Emperor Arcadius and Empress Aelia Eudoxia. She was the second child born to Arcadius and Eudoxia. Her older sister was Flaccilla, who was born in 397 but is assumed to have died young. Her younger siblings were Arcadia, born in 400, Theodosius II, the future emperor, and Marina, both born in 401.[1] When her father Arcadius died in 408, her brother Theodosius II was made Emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire, at seven years old. On July 4, 414 a fifteen-year-old Pulcheria proclaimed herself regent over her brother, then thirteen years of age, and made herself Augusta and Empress of the Eastern Roman Empire. According to the ancient historian Sozomen, in his Ecclesiastical History, Pulcheria took a vow of virginity when she became Augusta, and her sisters followed suit. Theodosius II died on July 26, 450, and Pulcheria soon married Marcian on November 25, 450. Marcian and Pulcheria were proclaimed Emperor and Empress of the Eastern Roman Empire. Three years later, in July 453, Pulcheria died; she was later made a saint by the Church.[2] Pulcheria is known to have held a significant amount of power in her brothers reign as emperor. Pulcheria was also of great influence over the church and theological practices of this time. She had influence over anti-pagan policies, church building projects, and the debate over the Marian title Theotokos (Birth-giver to God).Contents  [hide] 1 Biography1.1 Early life1.2 The Emperors Guardian1.3 Vow of virginity1.4 Augusta1.5 Empress1.5.1 Church conflict1.6 Death2 Relationship with Aelia Eudocia3 Influence over the church4 See also5 Notes6 ReferencesBiography[edit]Early life[edit]Pulcheria was born into the royal House of Theodosius, a dynasty of the later Roman empire, ruling in Constantinople. Her father was Arcadius, and her mother was Aelia Eudoxia. Like Pulcheria, her mother was also powerful and of great influence over the church, however not in the same way Pulcheria was. Arcadius reign was marked by the conflict between his wife and the Bishop of Constantinople,“Although his reign (Arcadius) was short, it is remembered in part for the controversial conflicts Eudoxia encountered with John Chrysostom, bishop of Constantinople from 398 to 404.[3] According to the ancient historian Sozomen, in his Ecclesiastical History, Sozomen claims that much of the rivalry was based on an ornate statue made in the honor of Eudoxia which Chrysostom condemned, “The silver statue of the empress...was placed upon a column of porphyry; and the event was celebrated by loud acclamations, dancing, games, and other manifestations of public rejoicing...John declared that these proceedings reflected dishonor on the church.”[4] According to Sozomen, John had also condemned the empress for her grandiose style of ruling over the empire and condemned her in the church, this of course enraged the empress and John was immediately disposed of. Later in life, Pulcheria would bring back the remains of John Chrysostom and make them into relics for the church, in gratitude for his pious life.[5] Eudoxia died in 404 and the emperor Arcadius died in 408. The emperor left behind four young children, including a seven-year-old Theodosius II. Theodosius was made emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire in 408, immediately after his father died. Two praetorian prefects were selected as regents over Theodosius, one being Anthemius and the other, Antiochus; both took over as regent. Eventually Pulcheria herself would take over as regent for her brother.The Emperors Guardian[edit]Once Pulcheria came of age, at fifteen, she felt, like her brother, that her family had no need for Antiochus any longer; her brother dismissed him of his duties. She then became her own brother’s regent: “In 412 Pulcheria quarreled with Antiochus, who like Anthemius had served the dynasty faithfully for a number of years, and induced her brother to dismiss him from the duties of praepositus. She then took personal charge of the imperial family, directing its affairs with such authority that she became known in society at large as the emperor’s guardian.”[6] Immediately when Pulcheria took authority over the imperial palace, the palace took on a much more monastic tone compared to that of her mother’s palace. Sozomen describes Pulcheria’s and her sisters pious ways in his Ecclesiastical History: “They all pursue the same mode of life; they are sedulous in their attendance in the house of prayer, and evince great charity towards strangers and the poor...and pass their days and their nights together in singing the praises of God.”[7] Rituals within the imperial palace also included chanting and reciting passages in the scripture, and fasting twice a week.[6] The sisters were known to have given up luxurious jewelry and apparel worn by most women of the imperial court of the past. Pulcheria also took on the role of providing all the training necessary for Theodosius to become a successful emperor, once he came of age. Although the empire was technically to be ruled by Theodosius II when he would come of age, his older sister Pulcheria exercised such profound influence over him all his life that she must be considered the co-regent of the empire until her death in 453. In fact it can be said without exaggeration that Pulcheria gave the identity to her brothers reign.[8] Pulcherias training of Theodosius included, ...how an Emperor must walk, and ride his horse, alone or in procession; how he should sit upon his throne: how to wear his Imperial armor and robes; and how to speak with dignity. By no means must he yield to loud laughter...[9] Not only did Pulcheria train her brother on the duties and customs of becoming an Emperor, but she also made sure Theodosius was trained to be a pious Christian leader. Once Theodosius came of age to rule as sole Emperor, according to many historians, the teachings of his sister had been ignored. “He was by nature kind, affable, easily led...Not only was he foolishly kind; he was careless, and often he was to neglect his duty in the administration of his Empire.”[10] This lack of power that Theodosius exemplified led to Pulcheria taking on a much larger role of authority and influence in the Empire.Vow of virginity[edit]At the same time Pulcheria proclaimed herself as guardian over her brother she also took a vow of virginity, and her sisters did as well. Pulcheria’s reason for a vow of virginity may have been her deeply religious virtue as recorded by Sozomen: “She devoted her virginity to God, and instructed her sisters to do likewise. To avoid cause of scandal and opportunities for intrigue, she permitted no man to enter her palace. In confirmation of her resolution she took God, the priests, and all the subjects of the Roman empire as witnesses...”[11] Another contemporary of Pulcheria had also described her deep piety. In a letter from Pope Leo I to Pulcheria, he compliments her on her deeply religious ways: In it you clearly show how much you love the Catholic faith and how much you despise the errors of heretics.[12] Along with being deeply pious, it is possible that Pulcheria may have had other motives to take a vow of virginity. According to ancient historians Sozomen, Socrates, and Theodoret, Pulcheria had a deep dislike for Anthemius, the former guardian of Theodosius;[13] the reasons may have been his distaste for her immense power within the empire and her unwillingness to allow Anthemius to gain power amongst the imperial court. A more recent historian, Kenneth Holum, states that Anthemius had tried to make family ties between himself and the imperial family: “Married long since and many years Pulcheria’s senior, Anthemis naturally proposed a descendent or close relative, a grandson perhaps...born a few years earlier than Pulcheria and an excellent prospect for her hand”[14] Pulcheria had found herself in a position where she would have to give her power up to her potential husband, for once a woman in the imperial court married her power was to be relinquished to her husband. In order for Pulcheria to keep her power within the imperial court she took a vow of virginity to ensure that another man could not share her power.Augusta[edit]In 414 the Roman senate made Pulcheria Augusta. During her time as Augusta, Pulcheria held a great deal of power in politics and although she was a woman was treated equally among other men of power.

In order for Pulcheria to keep her power within the imperial court she took a vow of virginity to ensure that another man could not share her power.Augusta[edit]In 414 the Roman senate made Pulcheria Augusta. During her time as Augusta, Pulcheria held a great deal of power in politics and although she was a woman was treated equally among other men of power. In the senate of Constantinople lay a bust in her honor along with the other Augusti.[15] Many important events occurred during her time as Augusta and her brothers reign as emperor; however, Pulcheria’s influence was mostly in the church. Pulcheria and her brother were known to have harbored anti Jewish sentiment, and both had started to enact laws against Jewish worship in the city of Constantinople. Before the reign of Theodosius II, synagogues were seen as private property and were protected by the imperial government. In Theodosius’s reign he enacted a law that forbade the construction of synagogues, and demanded the destruction of synagogues as well. Pulcheria and Theodosius also ordered that a group of Jews be killed after strife amongst Christians emerged in Palestine.[16] It was well known that Pulcheria had little respect for Jewish people, stemmed by her disapproval of Nestorian theological practices; Kenneth Holum writes “Pulcheria had long nursed a special hatred for Jews, and the Nestorian heresy, which appeared to contemporaries to be of Jewish origin; no doubt had served to confirm that hatred.”[17] Although Pulcheria was known to have strong feelings against pagans and Jews alike, she was known for her philanthropic spirit as well. She had built many churches in and around the city of Constantinople, she had also built many buildings for the poor in the city Sozomen writes that it would take too much time to describe all the churches Pulcheria built, as well as hospitals and inns for the poor.[18] Pulcherias building projects were so vast in Constantinople that a whole district was named in her honor called the Pulcherianai, Some of these establishments were extensive enough to give the names of their proprietors to entire quarters of the city such as the Marina quarter in the second region and the Pulcherianai in the eleventh.[19] As well as contributing to the city with new churches and districts, Pulcheria contributed significantly to the church by bringing back bishops or remains of bishops who had once been dismissed as relics to the church. Pope Leo I describes Pulcherias contributions to the church in a letter to her, ...the entire Roman Church is most grateful to you for all the works of your faith, whether having assisted envoys in every way with devoted affection and for having brought back the Catholic bishops who were ejected from their churches by an unjust sentence, or for having brought back with fitting honor to the church he governed so well the remains of Flavian of holy memory, an innocent and Catholic bishop.[20] Pulcherias time as Augusta was also marked with war and ongoing conflict with Persia. Pulcheria had inspired war against Persia when Persian King Yazdegerd I executed a Christian bishop who destroyed an Zoroastrian altar.[21] Under the influence of Pulcheria, Theodosius sent troops into battle against Persia, the fanaticism over the war by the people of the empire was described by Sozomen as ready to do anything for the sake of Christianity.[21] Pulcheria and Theodosius were victorious in their invasion of Persia, and according to historians Theodosius had credited his sisters vow of virginity as the reason for victory. Surviving letters identify the source of that victory through the vows of his sisters. In his view, when Pulcheria devoted her virginity to God and imposed the same vow on her sisters, she secured Gods favor, causing every threat and war raised against her brother to disperse spontaneously.[22] Theodosius had made his sisters virginity a tool of war propaganda, and because of her vow to be faithful only to God the hand of God would help Roman troops in battle against Persia. Pulcherias power would become even greater after the death of her brother Theodosius II.Aelia Pulcheria (January 19, 398 or 399 – 453) was the daughter of Eastern Roman Emperor Arcadius and Empress Aelia Eudoxia. She was the second child born to Arcadius and Eudoxia. Her older sister was Flaccilla, who was born in 397 but is assumed to have died young. Her younger siblings were Arcadia, born in 400, Theodosius II, the future emperor, and Marina, both born in 401.[1] When her father Arcadius died in 408, her brother Theodosius II was made Emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire, at seven years old. On July 4, 414 a fifteen-year-old Pulcheria proclaimed herself regent over her brother, then thirteen years of age, and made herself Augusta and Empress of the Eastern Roman Empire. According to the ancient historian Sozomen, in his Ecclesiastical History, Pulcheria took a vow of virginity when she became Augusta, and her sisters followed suit. Theodosius II died on July 26, 450, and Pulcheria soon married Marcian on November 25, 450. Marcian and Pulcheria were proclaimed Emperor and Empress of the Eastern Roman Empire. Three years later, in July 453, Pulcheria died; she was later made a saint by the Church.[2] Pulcheria is known to have held a significant amount of power in her brothers reign as emperor. Pulcheria was also of great influence over the church and theological practices of this time. She had influence over anti-pagan policies, church building projects, and the debate over the Marian title Theotokos (Birth-giver to God).Contents  [hide] 1 Biography1.1 Early life1.2 The Emperors Guardian1.3 Vow of virginity1.4 Augusta1.5 Empress1.5.1 Church conflict1.6 Death2 Relationship with Aelia Eudocia3 Influence over the church4 See also5 Notes6 ReferencesBiography[edit]Early life[edit]Pulcheria was born into the royal House of Theodosius, a dynasty of the later Roman empire, ruling in Constantinople. Her father was Arcadius, and her mother was Aelia Eudoxia. Like Pulcheria, her mother was also powerful and of great influence over the church, however not in the same way Pulcheria was. Arcadius reign was marked by the conflict between his wife and the Bishop of Constantinople,“Although his reign (Arcadius) was short, it is remembered in part for the controversial conflicts Eudoxia encountered with John Chrysostom, bishop of Constantinople from 398 to 404.[3] According to the ancient historian Sozomen, in his Ecclesiastical History, Sozomen claims that much of the rivalry was based on an ornate statue made in the honor of Eudoxia which Chrysostom condemned, “The silver statue of the empress...was placed upon a column of porphyry; and the event was celebrated by loud acclamations, dancing, games, and other manifestations of public rejoicing...John declared that these proceedings reflected dishonor on the church.”[4] According to Sozomen, John had also condemned the empress for her grandiose style of ruling over the empire and condemned her in the church, this of course enraged the empress and John was immediately disposed of. Later in life, Pulcheria would bring back the remains of John Chrysostom and make them into relics for the church, in gratitude for his pious life.[5] Eudoxia died in 404 and the emperor Arcadius died in 408. The emperor left behind four young children, including a seven-year-old Theodosius II. Theodosius was made emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire in 408, immediately after his father died. Two praetorian prefects were selected as regents over Theodosius, one being Anthemius and the other, Antiochus; both took over as regent. Eventually Pulcheria herself would take over as regent for her brother.The Emperors Guardian[edit]Once Pulcheria came of age, at fifteen, she felt, like her brother, that her family had no need for Antiochus any longer; her brother dismissed him of his duties. She then became her own brother’s regent: “In 412 Pulcheria quarreled with Antiochus, who like Anthemius had served the dynasty faithfully for a number of years, and induced her brother to dismiss him from the duties of praepositus. She then took personal charge of the imperial family, directing its affairs with such authority that she became known in society at large as the emperor’s guardian.”[6] Immediately when Pulcheria took authority over the imperial palace, the palace took on a much more monastic tone compared to that of her mother’s palace. Sozomen describes Pulcheria’s and her sisters pious ways in his Ecclesiastical History: “They all pursue the same mode of life; they are sedulous in their attendance in the house of prayer, and evince great charity towards strangers and the poor...and pass their days and their nights together in singing the praises of God.”[7] Rituals within the imperial palace also included chanting and reciting passages in the scripture, and fasting twice a week.[6] The sisters were known to have given up luxurious jewelry and apparel worn by most women of the imperial court of the past. Pulcheria also took on the role of providing all the training necessary for Theodosius to become a successful emperor, once he came of age. Although the empire was technically to be ruled by Theodosius II when he would come of age, his older sister Pulcheria exercised such profound influence over him all his life that she must be considered the co-regent of the empire until her death in 453. In fact it can be said without exaggeration that Pulcheria gave the identity to her brothers reign.[8] Pulcherias training of Theodosius included, ...how an Emperor must walk, and ride his horse, alone or in procession; how he should sit upon his throne: how to wear his Imperial armor and robes; and how to speak with dignity. By no means must he yield to loud laughter...[9] Not only did Pulcheria train her brother on the duties and customs of becoming an Emperor, but she also made sure Theodosius was trained to be a pious Christian leader. Once Theodosius came of age to rule as sole Emperor, according to many historians, the teachings of his sister had been ignored. “He was by nature kind, affable, easily led...Not only was he foolishly kind; he was careless, and often he was to neglect his duty in the administration of his Empire.”[10] This lack of power that Theodosius exemplified led to Pulcheria taking on a much larger role of authority and influence in the Empire.Vow of virginity[edit]At the same time Pulcheria proclaimed herself as guardian over her brother she also took a vow of virginity, and her sisters did as well. Pulcheria’s reason for a vow of virginity may have been her deeply religious virtue as recorded by Sozomen: “She devoted her virginity to God, and instructed her sisters to do likewise. To avoid cause of scandal and opportunities for intrigue, she permitted no man to enter her palace. In confirmation of her resolution she took God, the priests, and all the subjects of the Roman empire as witnesses...”[11] Another contemporary of Pulcheria had also described her deep piety. In a letter from Pope Leo I to Pulcheria, he compliments her on her deeply religious ways: In it you clearly show how much you love the Catholic faith and how much you despise the errors of heretics.[12] Along with being deeply pious, it is possible that Pulcheria may have had other motives to take a vow of virginity. According to ancient historians Sozomen, Socrates, and Theodoret, Pulcheria had a deep dislike for Anthemius, the former guardian of Theodosius;[13] the reasons may have been his distaste for her immense power within the empire and her unwillingness to allow Anthemius to gain power amongst the imperial court.

According to ancient historians Sozomen, Socrates, and Theodoret, Pulcheria had a deep dislike for Anthemius, the former guardian of Theodosius;[13] the reasons may have been his distaste for her immense power within the empire and her unwillingness to allow Anthemius to gain power amongst the imperial court. A more recent historian, Kenneth Holum, states that Anthemius had tried to make family ties between himself and the imperial family: “Married long since and many years Pulcheria’s senior, Anthemis naturally proposed a descendent or close relative, a grandson perhaps...born a few years earlier than Pulcheria and an excellent prospect for her hand”[14] Pulcheria had found herself in a position where she would have to give her power up to her potential husband, for once a woman in the imperial court married her power was to be relinquished to her husband. In order for Pulcheria to keep her power within the imperial court she took a vow of virginity to ensure that another man could not share her power.Augusta[edit]In 414 the Roman senate made Pulcheria Augusta. During her time as Augusta, Pulcheria held a great deal of power in politics and although she was a woman was treated equally among other men of power. In the senate of Constantinople lay a bust in her honor along with the other Augusti.[15] Many important events occurred during her time as Augusta and her brothers reign as emperor; however, Pulcheria’s influence was mostly in the church. Pulcheria and her brother were known to have harbored anti Jewish sentiment, and both had started to enact laws against Jewish worship in the city of Constantinople. Before the reign of Theodosius II, synagogues were seen as private property and were protected by the imperial government. In Theodosius’s reign he enacted a law that forbade the construction of synagogues, and demanded the destruction of synagogues as well. Pulcheria and Theodosius also ordered that a group of Jews be killed after strife amongst Christians emerged in Palestine.[16] It was well known that Pulcheria had little respect for Jewish people, stemmed by her disapproval of Nestorian theological practices; Kenneth Holum writes “Pulcheria had long nursed a special hatred for Jews, and the Nestorian heresy, which appeared to contemporaries to be of Jewish origin; no doubt had served to confirm that hatred.”[17] Although Pulcheria was known to have strong feelings against pagans and Jews alike, she was known for her philanthropic spirit as well. She had built many churches in and around the city of Constantinople, she had also built many buildings for the poor in the city Sozomen writes that it would take too much time to describe all the churches Pulcheria built, as well as hospitals and inns for the poor.[18] Pulcherias building projects were so vast in Constantinople that a whole district was named in her honor called the Pulcherianai, Some of these establishments were extensive enough to give the names of their proprietors to entire quarters of the city such as the Marina quarter in the second region and the Pulcherianai in the eleventh.[19] As well as contributing to the city with new churches and districts, Pulcheria contributed significantly to the church by bringing back bishops or remains of bishops who had once been dismissed as relics to the church. Pope Leo I describes Pulcherias contributions to the church in a letter to her, ...the entire Roman Church is most grateful to you for all the works of your faith, whether having assisted envoys in every way with devoted affection and for having brought back the Catholic bishops who were ejected from their churches by an unjust sentence, or for having brought back with fitting honor to the church he governed so well the remains of Flavian of holy memory, an innocent and Catholic bishop.[20] Pulcherias time as Augusta was also marked with war and ongoing conflict with Persia. Pulcheria had inspired war against Persia when Persian King Yazdegerd I executed a Christian bishop who destroyed an Zoroastrian altar.[21] Under the influence of Pulcheria, Theodosius sent troops into battle against Persia, the fanaticism over the war by the people of the empire was described by Sozomen as ready to do anything for the sake of Christianity.[21] Pulcheria and Theodosius were victorious in their invasion of Persia, and according to historians Theodosius had credited his sisters vow of virginity as the reason for victory. Surviving letters identify the source of that victory through the vows of his sisters. In his view, when Pulcheria devoted her virginity to God and imposed the same vow on her sisters, she secured Gods favor, causing every threat and war raised against her brother to disperse spontaneously.[22] Theodosius had made his sisters virginity a tool of war propaganda, and because of her vow to be faithful only to God the hand of God would help Roman troops in battle against Persia. Pulcherias power would become even greater after the death of her brother Theodosius II.Aelia Pulcheria (January 19, 398 or 399 – 453) was the daughter of Eastern Roman Emperor Arcadius and Empress Aelia Eudoxia. She was the second child born to Arcadius and Eudoxia. Her older sister was Flaccilla, who was born in 397 but is assumed to have died young. Her younger siblings were Arcadia, born in 400, Theodosius II, the future emperor, and Marina, both born in 401.[1] When her father Arcadius died in 408, her brother Theodosius II was made Emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire, at seven years old. On July 4, 414 a fifteen-year-old Pulcheria proclaimed herself regent over her brother, then thirteen years of age, and made herself Augusta and Empress of the Eastern Roman Empire. According to the ancient historian Sozomen, in his Ecclesiastical History, Pulcheria took a vow of virginity when she became Augusta, and her sisters followed suit. Theodosius II died on July 26, 450, and Pulcheria soon married Marcian on November 25, 450. Marcian and Pulcheria were proclaimed Emperor and Empress of the Eastern Roman Empire. Three years later, in July 453, Pulcheria died; she was later made a saint by the Church.[2] Pulcheria is known to have held a significant amount of power in her brothers reign as emperor. Pulcheria was also of great influence over the church and theological practices of this time. She had influence over anti-pagan policies, church building projects, and the debate over the Marian title Theotokos (Birth-giver to God).Contents  [hide] 1 Biography1.1 Early life1.2 The Emperors Guardian1.3 Vow of virginity1.4 Augusta1.5 Empress1.5.1 Church conflict1.6 Death2 Relationship with Aelia Eudocia3 Influence over the church4 See also5 Notes6 ReferencesBiography[edit]Early life[edit]Pulcheria was born into the royal House of Theodosius, a dynasty of the later Roman empire, ruling in Constantinople. Her father was Arcadius, and her mother was Aelia Eudoxia. Like Pulcheria, her mother was also powerful and of great influence over the church, however not in the same way Pulcheria was. Arcadius reign was marked by the conflict between his wife and the Bishop of Constantinople,“Although his reign (Arcadius) was short, it is remembered in part for the controversial conflicts Eudoxia encountered with John Chrysostom, bishop of Constantinople from 398 to 404.[3] According to the ancient historian Sozomen, in his Ecclesiastical History, Sozomen claims that much of the rivalry was based on an ornate statue made in the honor of Eudoxia which Chrysostom condemned, “The silver statue of the empress...was placed upon a column of porphyry; and the event was celebrated by loud acclamations, dancing, games, and other manifestations of public rejoicing...John declared that these proceedings reflected dishonor on the church.”[4] According to Sozomen, John had also condemned the empress for her grandiose style of ruling over the empire and condemned her in the church, this of course enraged the empress and John was immediately disposed of. Later in life, Pulcheria would bring back the remains of John Chrysostom and make them into relics for the church, in gratitude for his pious life.[5] Eudoxia died in 404 and the emperor Arcadius died in 408. The emperor left behind four young children, including a seven-year-old Theodosius II. Theodosius was made emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire in 408, immediately after his father died. Two praetorian prefects were selected as regents over Theodosius, one being Anthemius and the other, Antiochus; both took over as regent. Eventually Pulcheria herself would take over as regent for her brother.The Emperors Guardian[edit]Once Pulcheria came of age, at fifteen, she felt, like her brother, that her family had no need for Antiochus any longer; her brother dismissed him of his duties. She then became her own brother’s regent: “In 412 Pulcheria quarreled with Antiochus, who like Anthemius had served the dynasty faithfully for a number of years, and induced her brother to dismiss him from the duties of praepositus. She then took personal charge of the imperial family, directing its affairs with such authority that she became known in society at large as the emperor’s guardian.”[6] Immediately when Pulcheria took authority over the imperial palace, the palace took on a much more monastic tone compared to that of her mother’s palace. Sozomen describes Pulcheria’s and her sisters pious ways in his Ecclesiastical History: “They all pursue the same mode of life; they are sedulous in their attendance in the house of prayer, and evince great charity towards strangers and the poor...and pass their days and their nights together in singing the praises of God.”[7] Rituals within the imperial palace also included chanting and reciting passages in the scripture, and fasting twice a week.[6] The sisters were known to have given up luxurious jewelry and apparel worn by most women of the imperial court of the past. Pulcheria also took on the role of providing all the training necessary for Theodosius to become a successful emperor, once he came of age. Although the empire was technically to be ruled by Theodosius II when he would come of age, his older sister Pulcheria exercised such profound influence over him all his life that she must be considered the co-regent of the empire until her death in 453. In fact it can be said without exaggeration that Pulcheria gave the identity to her brothers reign.[8] Pulcherias training of Theodosius included, ...how an Emperor must walk, and ride his horse, alone or in procession; how he should sit upon his throne: how to wear his Imperial armor and robes; and how to speak with dignity. By no means must he yield to loud laughter...[9] Not only did Pulcheria train her brother on the duties and customs of becoming an Emperor, but she also made sure Theodosius was trained to be a pious Christian leader. Once Theodosius came of age to rule as sole Emperor, according to many historians, the teachings of his sister had been ignored. “He was by nature kind, affable, easily led...Not only was he foolishly kind; he was careless, and often he was to neglect his duty in the administration of his Empire.”[10] This lack of power that Theodosius exemplified led to Pulcheria taking on a much larger role of authority and influence in the Empire.Vow of virginity[edit]At the same time Pulcheria proclaimed herself as guardian over her brother she also took a vow of virginity, and her sisters did as well. Pulcheria’s reason for a vow of virginity may have been her deeply religious virtue as recorded by Sozomen: “She devoted her virginity to God, and instructed her sisters to do likewise. To avoid cause of scandal and opportunities for intrigue, she permitted no man to enter her palace. In confirmation of her resolution she took God, the priests, and all the subjects of the Roman empire as witnesses...”[11] Another contemporary of Pulcheria had also described her deep piety. In a letter from Pope Leo I to Pulcheria, he compliments her on her deeply religious ways: In it you clearly show how much you love the Catholic faith and how much you despise the errors of heretics.[12] Along with being deeply pious, it is possible that Pulcheria may have had other motives to take a vow of virginity.

In a letter from Pope Leo I to Pulcheria, he compliments her on her deeply religious ways: In it you clearly show how much you love the Catholic faith and how much you despise the errors of heretics.[12] Along with being deeply pious, it is possible that Pulcheria may have had other motives to take a vow of virginity. According to ancient historians Sozomen, Socrates, and Theodoret, Pulcheria had a deep dislike for Anthemius, the former guardian of Theodosius;[13] the reasons may have been his distaste for her immense power within the empire and her unwillingness to allow Anthemius to gain power amongst the imperial court. A more recent historian, Kenneth Holum, states that Anthemius had tried to make family ties between himself and the imperial family: “Married long since and many years Pulcheria’s senior, Anthemis naturally proposed a descendent or close relative, a grandson perhaps...born a few years earlier than Pulcheria and an excellent prospect for her hand”[14] Pulcheria had found herself in a position where she would have to give her power up to her potential husband, for once a woman in the imperial court married her power was to be relinquished to her husband. In order for Pulcheria to keep her power within the imperial court she took a vow of virginity to ensure that another man could not share her power.Augusta[edit]In 414 the Roman senate made Pulcheria Augusta. During her time as Augusta, Pulcheria held a great deal of power in politics and although she was a woman was treated equally among other men of power. In the senate of Constantinople lay a bust in her honor along with the other Augusti.[15] Many important events occurred during her time as Augusta and her brothers reign as emperor; however, Pulcheria’s influence was mostly in the church. Pulcheria and her brother were known to have harbored anti Jewish sentiment, and both had started to enact laws against Jewish worship in the city of Constantinople. Before the reign of Theodosius II, synagogues were seen as private property and were protected by the imperial government. In Theodosius’s reign he enacted a law that forbade the construction of synagogues, and demanded the destruction of synagogues as well. Pulcheria and Theodosius also ordered that a group of Jews be killed after strife amongst Christians emerged in Palestine.[16] It was well known that Pulcheria had little respect for Jewish people, stemmed by her disapproval of Nestorian theological practices; Kenneth Holum writes “Pulcheria had long nursed a special hatred for Jews, and the Nestorian heresy, which appeared to contemporaries to be of Jewish origin; no doubt had served to confirm that hatred.”[17] Although Pulcheria was known to have strong feelings against pagans and Jews alike, she was known for her philanthropic spirit as well. She had built many churches in and around the city of Constantinople, she had also built many buildings for the poor in the city Sozomen writes that it would take too much time to describe all the churches Pulcheria built, as well as hospitals and inns for the poor.[18] Pulcherias building projects were so vast in Constantinople that a whole district was named in her honor called the Pulcherianai, Some of these establishments were extensive enough to give the names of their proprietors to entire quarters of the city such as the Marina quarter in the second region and the Pulcherianai in the eleventh.[19] As well as contributing to the city with new churches and districts, Pulcheria contributed significantly to the church by bringing back bishops or remains of bishops who had once been dismissed as relics to the church. Pope Leo I describes Pulcherias contributions to the church in a letter to her, ...the entire Roman Church is most grateful to you for all the works of your faith, whether having assisted envoys in every way with devoted affection and for having brought back the Catholic bishops who were ejected from their churches by an unjust sentence, or for having brought back with fitting honor to the church he governed so well the remains of Flavian of holy memory, an innocent and Catholic bishop.[20] Pulcherias time as Augusta was also marked with war and ongoing conflict with Persia. Pulcheria had inspired war against Persia when Persian King Yazdegerd I executed a Christian bishop who destroyed an Zoroastrian altar.[21] Under the influence of Pulcheria, Theodosius sent troops into battle against Persia, the fanaticism over the war by the people of the empire was described by Sozomen as ready to do anything for the sake of Christianity.[21] Pulcheria and Theodosius were victorious in their invasion of Persia, and according to historians Theodosius had credited his sisters vow of virginity as the reason for victory. Surviving letters identify the source of that victory through the vows of his sisters. In his view, when Pulcheria devoted her virginity to God and imposed the same vow on her sisters, she secured Gods favor, causing every threat and war raised against her brother to disperse spontaneously.[22] Theodosius had made his sisters virginity a tool of war propaganda, and because of her vow to be faithful only to God the hand of God would help Roman troops in battle against Persia. Pulcherias power would become even greater after the death of her brother Theodosius II.Aelia Pulcheria (January 19, 398 or 399 – 453) was the daughter of Eastern Roman Emperor Arcadius and Empress Aelia Eudoxia. She was the second child born to Arcadius and Eudoxia. Her older sister was Flaccilla, who was born in 397 but is assumed to have died young. Her younger siblings were Arcadia, born in 400, Theodosius II, the future emperor, and Marina, both born in 401.[1] When her father Arcadius died in 408, her brother Theodosius II was made Emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire, at seven years old. On July 4, 414 a fifteen-year-old Pulcheria proclaimed herself regent over her brother, then thirteen years of age, and made herself Augusta and Empress of the Eastern Roman Empire. According to the ancient historian Sozomen, in his Ecclesiastical History, Pulcheria took a vow of virginity when she became Augusta, and her sisters followed suit. Theodosius II died on July 26, 450, and Pulcheria soon married Marcian on November 25, 450. Marcian and Pulcheria were proclaimed Emperor and Empress of the Eastern Roman Empire. Three years later, in July 453, Pulcheria died; she was later made a saint by the Church.[2] Pulcheria is known to have held a significant amount of power in her brothers reign as emperor. Pulcheria was also of great influence over the church and theological practices of this time. She had influence over anti-pagan policies, church building projects, and the debate over the Marian title Theotokos (Birth-giver to God).Contents  [hide] 1 Biography1.1 Early life1.2 The Emperors Guardian1.3 Vow of virginity1.4 Augusta1.5 Empress1.5.1 Church conflict1.6 Death2 Relationship with Aelia Eudocia3 Influence over the church4 See also5 Notes6 ReferencesBiography[edit]Early life[edit]Pulcheria was born into the royal House of Theodosius, a dynasty of the later Roman empire, ruling in Constantinople. Her father was Arcadius, and her mother was Aelia Eudoxia. Like Pulcheria, her mother was also powerful and of great influence over the church, however not in the same way Pulcheria was. Arcadius reign was marked by the conflict between his wife and the Bishop of Constantinople,“Although his reign (Arcadius) was short, it is remembered in part for the controversial conflicts Eudoxia encountered with John Chrysostom, bishop of Constantinople from 398 to 404.[3] According to the ancient historian Sozomen, in his Ecclesiastical History, Sozomen claims that much of the rivalry was based on an ornate statue made in the honor of Eudoxia which Chrysostom condemned, “The silver statue of the empress...was placed upon a column of porphyry; and the event was celebrated by loud acclamations, dancing, games, and other manifestations of public rejoicing...John declared that these proceedings reflected dishonor on the church.”[4] According to Sozomen, John had also condemned the empress for her grandiose style of ruling over the empire and condemned her in the church, this of course enraged the empress and John was immediately disposed of. Later in life, Pulcheria would bring back the remains of John Chrysostom and make them into relics for the church, in gratitude for his pious life.[5] Eudoxia died in 404 and the emperor Arcadius died in 408. The emperor left behind four young children, including a seven-year-old Theodosius II. Theodosius was made emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire in 408, immediately after his father died. Two praetorian prefects were selected as regents over Theodosius, one being Anthemius and the other, Antiochus; both took over as regent. Eventually Pulcheria herself would take over as regent for her brother.The Emperors Guardian[edit]Once Pulcheria came of age, at fifteen, she felt, like her brother, that her family had no need for Antiochus any longer; her brother dismissed him of his duties. She then became her own brother’s regent: “In 412 Pulcheria quarreled with Antiochus, who like Anthemius had served the dynasty faithfully for a number of years, and induced her brother to dismiss him from the duties of praepositus. She then took personal charge of the imperial family, directing its affairs with such authority that she became known in society at large as the emperor’s guardian.”[6] Immediately when Pulcheria took authority over the imperial palace, the palace took on a much more monastic tone compared to that of her mother’s palace. Sozomen describes Pulcheria’s and her sisters pious ways in his Ecclesiastical History: “They all pursue the same mode of life; they are sedulous in their attendance in the house of prayer, and evince great charity towards strangers and the poor...and pass their days and their nights together in singing the praises of God.”[7] Rituals within the imperial palace also included chanting and reciting passages in the scripture, and fasting twice a week.[6] The sisters were known to have given up luxurious jewelry and apparel worn by most women of the imperial court of the past. Pulcheria also took on the role of providing all the training necessary for Theodosius to become a successful emperor, once he came of age. Although the empire was technically to be ruled by Theodosius II when he would come of age, his older sister Pulcheria exercised such profound influence over him all his life that she must be considered the co-regent of the empire until her death in 453. In fact it can be said without exaggeration that Pulcheria gave the identity to her brothers reign.[8] Pulcherias training of Theodosius included, ...how an Emperor must walk, and ride his horse, alone or in procession; how he should sit upon his throne: how to wear his Imperial armor and robes; and how to speak with dignity. By no means must he yield to loud laughter...[9] Not only did Pulcheria train her brother on the duties and customs of becoming an Emperor, but she also made sure Theodosius was trained to be a pious Christian leader. Once Theodosius came of age to rule as sole Emperor, according to many historians, the teachings of his sister had been ignored. “He was by nature kind, affable, easily led...Not only was he foolishly kind; he was careless, and often he was to neglect his duty in the administration of his Empire.”[10] This lack of power that Theodosius exemplified led to Pulcheria taking on a much larger role of authority and influence in the Empire.Vow of virginity[edit]At the same time Pulcheria proclaimed herself as guardian over her brother she also took a vow of virginity, and her sisters did as well. Pulcheria’s reason for a vow of virginity may have been her deeply religious virtue as recorded by Sozomen: “She devoted her virginity to God, and instructed her sisters to do likewise. To avoid cause of scandal and opportunities for intrigue, she permitted no man to enter her palace. In confirmation of her resolution she took God, the priests, and all the subjects of the Roman empire as witnesses...”[11] Another contemporary of Pulcheria had also described her deep piety.

In confirmation of her resolution she took God, the priests, and all the subjects of the Roman empire as witnesses...”[11] Another contemporary of Pulcheria had also described her deep piety. In a letter from Pope Leo I to Pulcheria, he compliments her on her deeply religious ways: In it you clearly show how much you love the Catholic faith and how much you despise the errors of heretics.[12] Along with being deeply pious, it is possible that Pulcheria may have had other motives to take a vow of virginity. According to ancient historians Sozomen, Socrates, and Theodoret, Pulcheria had a deep dislike for Anthemius, the former guardian of Theodosius;[13] the reasons may have been his distaste for her immense power within the empire and her unwillingness to allow Anthemius to gain power amongst the imperial court. A more recent historian, Kenneth Holum, states that Anthemius had tried to make family ties between himself and the imperial family: “Married long since and many years Pulcheria’s senior, Anthemis naturally proposed a descendent or close relative, a grandson perhaps...born a few years earlier than Pulcheria and an excellent prospect for her hand”[14] Pulcheria had found herself in a position where she would have to give her power up to her potential husband, for once a woman in the imperial court married her power was to be relinquished to her husband. In order for Pulcheria to keep her power within the imperial court she took a vow of virginity to ensure that another man could not share her power.Augusta[edit]In 414 the Roman senate made Pulcheria Augusta. During her time as Augusta, Pulcheria held a great deal of power in politics and although she was a woman was treated equally among other men of power. In the senate of Constantinople lay a bust in her honor along with the other Augusti.[15] Many important events occurred during her time as Augusta and her brothers reign as emperor; however, Pulcheria’s influence was mostly in the church. Pulcheria and her brother were known to have harbored anti Jewish sentiment, and both had started to enact laws against Jewish worship in the city of Constantinople. Before the reign of Theodosius II, synagogues were seen as private property and were protected by the imperial government. In Theodosius’s reign he enacted a law that forbade the construction of synagogues, and demanded the destruction of synagogues as well. Pulcheria and Theodosius also ordered that a group of Jews be killed after strife amongst Christians emerged in Palestine.[16] It was well known that Pulcheria had little respect for Jewish people, stemmed by her disapproval of Nestorian theological practices; Kenneth Holum writes “Pulcheria had long nursed a special hatred for Jews, and the Nestorian heresy, which appeared to contemporaries to be of Jewish origin; no doubt had served to confirm that hatred.”[17] Although Pulcheria was known to have strong feelings against pagans and Jews alike, she was known for her philanthropic spirit as well. She had built many churches in and around the city of Constantinople, she had also built many buildings for the poor in the city Sozomen writes that it would take too much time to describe all the churches Pulcheria built, as well as hospitals and inns for the poor.[18] Pulcherias building projects were so vast in Constantinople that a whole district was named in her honor called the Pulcherianai, Some of these establishments were extensive enough to give the names of their proprietors to entire quarters of the city such as the Marina quarter in the second region and the Pulcherianai in the eleventh.[19] As well as contributing to the city with new churches and districts, Pulcheria contributed significantly to the church by bringing back bishops or remains of bishops who had once been dismissed as relics to the church. Pope Leo I describes Pulcherias contributions to the church in a letter to her, ...the entire Roman Church is most grateful to you for all the works of your faith, whether having assisted envoys in every way with devoted affection and for having brought back the Catholic bishops who were ejected from their churches by an unjust sentence, or for having brought back with fitting honor to the church he governed so well the remains of Flavian of holy memory, an innocent and Catholic bishop.[20] Pulcherias time as Augusta was also marked with war and ongoing conflict with Persia. Pulcheria had inspired war against Persia when Persian King Yazdegerd I executed a Christian bishop who destroyed an Zoroastrian altar.[21] Under the influence of Pulcheria, Theodosius sent troops into battle against Persia, the fanaticism over the war by the people of the empire was described by Sozomen as ready to do anything for the sake of Christianity.[21] Pulcheria and Theodosius were victorious in their invasion of Persia, and according to historians Theodosius had credited his sisters vow of virginity as the reason for victory. Surviving letters identify the source of that victory through the vows of his sisters. In his view, when Pulcheria devoted her virginity to God and imposed the same vow on her sisters, she secured Gods favor, causing every threat and war raised against her brother to disperse spontaneously.[22] Theodosius had made his sisters virginity a tool of war propaganda, and because of her vow to be faithful only to God the hand of God would help Roman troops in battle against Persia. Pulcherias power would become even greater after the death of her brother Theodosius II.Aelia Pulcheria (January 19, 398 or 399 – 453) was the daughter of Eastern Roman Emperor Arcadius and Empress Aelia Eudoxia. She was the second child born to Arcadius and Eudoxia. Her older sister was Flaccilla, who was born in 397 but is assumed to have died young. Her younger siblings were Arcadia, born in 400, Theodosius II, the future emperor, and Marina, both born in 401.[1] When her father Arcadius died in 408, her brother Theodosius II was made Emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire, at seven years old. On July 4, 414 a fifteen-year-old Pulcheria proclaimed herself regent over her brother, then thirteen years of age, and made herself Augusta and Empress of the Eastern Roman Empire. According to the ancient historian Sozomen, in his Ecclesiastical History, Pulcheria took a vow of virginity when she became Augusta, and her sisters followed suit. Theodosius II died on July 26, 450, and Pulcheria soon married Marcian on November 25, 450. Marcian and Pulcheria were proclaimed Emperor and Empress of the Eastern Roman Empire. Three years later, in July 453, Pulcheria died; she was later made a saint by the Church.[2] Pulcheria is known to have held a significant amount of power in her brothers reign as emperor. Pulcheria was also of great influence over the church and theological practices of this time. She had influence over anti-pagan policies, church building projects, and the debate over the Marian title Theotokos (Birth-giver to God).Contents  [hide] 1 Biography1.1 Early life1.2 The Emperors Guardian1.3 Vow of virginity1.4 Augusta1.5 Empress1.5.1 Church conflict1.6 Death2 Relationship with Aelia Eudocia3 Influence over the church4 See also5 Notes6 ReferencesBiography[edit]Early life[edit]Pulcheria was born into the royal House of Theodosius, a dynasty of the later Roman empire, ruling in Constantinople. Her father was Arcadius, and her mother was Aelia Eudoxia. Like Pulcheria, her mother was also powerful and of great influence over the church, however not in the same way Pulcheria was. Arcadius reign was marked by the conflict between his wife and the Bishop of Constantinople,“Although his reign (Arcadius) was short, it is remembered in part for the controversial conflicts Eudoxia encountered with John Chrysostom, bishop of Constantinople from 398 to 404.[3] According to the ancient historian Sozomen, in his Ecclesiastical History, Sozomen claims that much of the rivalry was based on an ornate statue made in the honor of Eudoxia which Chrysostom condemned, “The silver statue of the empress...was placed upon a column of porphyry; and the event was celebrated by loud acclamations, dancing, games, and other manifestations of public rejoicing...John declared that these proceedings reflected dishonor on the church.”[4] According to Sozomen, John had also condemned the empress for her grandiose style of ruling over the empire and condemned her in the church, this of course enraged the empress and John was immediately disposed of. Later in life, Pulcheria would bring back the remains of John Chrysostom and make them into relics for the church, in gratitude for his pious life.[5] Eudoxia died in 404 and the emperor Arcadius died in 408. The emperor left behind four young children, including a seven-year-old Theodosius II. Theodosius was made emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire in 408, immediately after his father died. Two praetorian prefects were selected as regents over Theodosius, one being Anthemius and the other, Antiochus; both took over as regent. Eventually Pulcheria herself would take over as regent for her brother.The Emperors Guardian[edit]Once Pulcheria came of age, at fifteen, she felt, like her brother, that her family had no need for Antiochus any longer; her brother dismissed him of his duties. She then became her own brother’s regent: “In 412 Pulcheria quarreled with Antiochus, who like Anthemius had served the dynasty faithfully for a number of years, and induced her brother to dismiss him from the duties of praepositus. She then took personal charge of the imperial family, directing its affairs with such authority that she became known in society at large as the emperor’s guardian.”[6] Immediately when Pulcheria took authority over the imperial palace, the palace took on a much more monastic tone compared to that of her mother’s palace. Sozomen describes Pulcheria’s and her sisters pious ways in his Ecclesiastical History: “They all pursue the same mode of life; they are sedulous in their attendance in the house of prayer, and evince great charity towards strangers and the poor...and pass their days and their nights together in singing the praises of God.”[7] Rituals within the imperial palace also included chanting and reciting passages in the scripture, and fasting twice a week.[6] The sisters were known to have given up luxurious jewelry and apparel worn by most women of the imperial court of the past. Pulcheria also took on the role of providing all the training necessary for Theodosius to become a successful emperor, once he came of age. Although the empire was technically to be ruled by Theodosius II when he would come of age, his older sister Pulcheria exercised such profound influence over him all his life that she must be considered the co-regent of the empire until her death in 453. In fact it can be said without exaggeration that Pulcheria gave the identity to her brothers reign.[8] Pulcherias training of Theodosius included, ...how an Emperor must walk, and ride his horse, alone or in procession; how he should sit upon his throne: how to wear his Imperial armor and robes; and how to speak with dignity. By no means must he yield to loud laughter...[9] Not only did Pulcheria train her brother on the duties and customs of becoming an Emperor, but she also made sure Theodosius was trained to be a pious Christian leader. Once Theodosius came of age to rule as sole Emperor, according to many historians, the teachings of his sister had been ignored. “He was by nature kind, affable, easily led...Not only was he foolishly kind; he was careless, and often he was to neglect his duty in the administration of his Empire.”[10] This lack of power that Theodosius exemplified led to Pulcheria taking on a much larger role of authority and influence in the Empire.Vow of virginity[edit]At the same time Pulcheria proclaimed herself as guardian over her brother she also took a vow of virginity, and her sisters did as well. Pulcheria’s reason for a vow of virginity may have been her deeply religious virtue as recorded by Sozomen: “She devoted her virginity to God, and instructed her sisters to do likewise. To avoid cause of scandal and opportunities for intrigue, she permitted no man to enter her palace.

To avoid cause of scandal and opportunities for intrigue, she permitted no man to enter her palace. In confirmation of her resolution she took God, the priests, and all the subjects of the Roman empire as witnesses...”[11] Another contemporary of Pulcheria had also described her deep piety. In a letter from Pope Leo I to Pulcheria, he compliments her on her deeply religious ways: In it you clearly show how much you love the Catholic faith and how much you despise the errors of heretics.[12] Along with being deeply pious, it is possible that Pulcheria may have had other motives to take a vow of virginity. According to ancient historians Sozomen, Socrates, and Theodoret, Pulcheria had a deep dislike for Anthemius, the former guardian of Theodosius;[13] the reasons may have been his distaste for her immense power within the empire and her unwillingness to allow Anthemius to gain power amongst the imperial court. A more recent historian, Kenneth Holum, states that Anthemius had tried to make family ties between himself and the imperial family: “Married long since and many years Pulcheria’s senior, Anthemis naturally proposed a descendent or close relative, a grandson perhaps...born a few years earlier than Pulcheria and an excellent prospect for her hand”[14] Pulcheria had found herself in a position where she would have to give her power up to her potential husband, for once a woman in the imperial court married her power was to be relinquished to her husband. In order for Pulcheria to keep her power within the imperial court she took a vow of virginity to ensure that another man could not share her power.Augusta[edit]In 414 the Roman senate made Pulcheria Augusta. During her time as Augusta, Pulcheria held a great deal of power in politics and although she was a woman was treated equally among other men of power. In the senate of Constantinople lay a bust in her honor along with the other Augusti.[15] Many important events occurred during her time as Augusta and her brothers reign as emperor; however, Pulcheria’s influence was mostly in the church. Pulcheria and her brother were known to have harbored anti Jewish sentiment, and both had started to enact laws against Jewish worship in the city of Constantinople. Before the reign of Theodosius II, synagogues were seen as private property and were protected by the imperial government. In Theodosius’s reign he enacted a law that forbade the construction of synagogues, and demanded the destruction of synagogues as well. Pulcheria and Theodosius also ordered that a group of Jews be killed after strife amongst Christians emerged in Palestine.[16] It was well known that Pulcheria had little respect for Jewish people, stemmed by her disapproval of Nestorian theological practices; Kenneth Holum writes “Pulcheria had long nursed a special hatred for Jews, and the Nestorian heresy, which appeared to contemporaries to be of Jewish origin; no doubt had served to confirm that hatred.”[17] Although Pulcheria was known to have strong feelings against pagans and Jews alike, she was known for her philanthropic spirit as well. She had built many churches in and around the city of Constantinople, she had also built many buildings for the poor in the city Sozomen writes that it would take too much time to describe all the churches Pulcheria built, as well as hospitals and inns for the poor.[18] Pulcherias building projects were so vast in Constantinople that a whole district was named in her honor called the Pulcherianai, Some of these establishments were extensive enough to give the names of their proprietors to entire quarters of the city such as the Marina quarter in the second region and the Pulcherianai in the eleventh.[19] As well as contributing to the city with new churches and districts, Pulcheria contributed significantly to the church by bringing back bishops or remains of bishops who had once been dismissed as relics to the church. Pope Leo I describes Pulcherias contributions to the church in a letter to her, ...the entire Roman Church is most grateful to you for all the works of your faith, whether having assisted envoys in every way with devoted affection and for having brought back the Catholic bishops who were ejected from their churches by an unjust sentence, or for having brought back with fitting honor to the church he governed so well the remains of Flavian of holy memory, an innocent and Catholic bishop.[20] Pulcherias time as Augusta was also marked with war and ongoing conflict with Persia. Pulcheria had inspired war against Persia when Persian King Yazdegerd I executed a Christian bishop who destroyed an Zoroastrian altar.[21] Under the influence of Pulcheria, Theodosius sent troops into battle against Persia, the fanaticism over the war by the people of the empire was described by Sozomen as ready to do anything for the sake of Christianity.[21] Pulcheria and Theodosius were victorious in their invasion of Persia, and according to historians Theodosius had credited his sisters vow of virginity as the reason for victory. Surviving letters identify the source of that victory through the vows of his sisters. In his view, when Pulcheria devoted her virginity to God and imposed the same vow on her sisters, she secured Gods favor, causing every threat and war raised against her brother to disperse spontaneously.[22] Theodosius had made his sisters virginity a tool of war propaganda, and because of her vow to be faithful only to God the hand of God would help Roman troops in battle against Persia. Pulcherias power would become even greater after the death of her brother Theodosius II.Aelia Pulcheria (January 19, 398 or 399 – 453) was the daughter of Eastern Roman Emperor Arcadius and Empress Aelia Eudoxia. She was the second child born to Arcadius and Eudoxia. Her older sister was Flaccilla, who was born in 397 but is assumed to have died young. Her younger siblings were Arcadia, born in 400, Theodosius II, the future emperor, and Marina, both born in 401.[1] When her father Arcadius died in 408, her brother Theodosius II was made Emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire, at seven years old. On July 4, 414 a fifteen-year-old Pulcheria proclaimed herself regent over her brother, then thirteen years of age, and made herself Augusta and Empress of the Eastern Roman Empire. According to the ancient historian Sozomen, in his Ecclesiastical History, Pulcheria took a vow of virginity when she became Augusta, and her sisters followed suit. Theodosius II died on July 26, 450, and Pulcheria soon married Marcian on November 25, 450. Marcian and Pulcheria were proclaimed Emperor and Empress of the Eastern Roman Empire. Three years later, in July 453, Pulcheria died; she was later made a saint by the Church.[2] Pulcheria is known to have held a significant amount of power in her brothers reign as emperor. Pulcheria was also of great influence over the church and theological practices of this time. She had influence over anti-pagan policies, church building projects, and the debate over the Marian title Theotokos (Birth-giver to God).Contents  [hide] 1 Biography1.1 Early life1.2 The Emperors Guardian1.3 Vow of virginity1.4 Augusta1.5 Empress1.5.1 Church conflict1.6 Death2 Relationship with Aelia Eudocia3 Influence over the church4 See also5 Notes6 ReferencesBiography[edit]Early life[edit]Pulcheria was born into the royal House of Theodosius, a dynasty of the later Roman empire, ruling in Constantinople. Her father was Arcadius, and her mother was Aelia Eudoxia. Like Pulcheria, her mother was also powerful and of great influence over the church, however not in the same way Pulcheria was. Arcadius reign was marked by the conflict between his wife and the Bishop of Constantinople,“Although his reign (Arcadius) was short, it is remembered in part for the controversial conflicts Eudoxia encountered with John Chrysostom, bishop of Constantinople from 398 to 404.[3] According to the ancient historian Sozomen, in his Ecclesiastical History, Sozomen claims that much of the rivalry was based on an ornate statue made in the honor of Eudoxia which Chrysostom condemned, “The silver statue of the empress...was placed upon a column of porphyry; and the event was celebrated by loud acclamations, dancing, games, and other manifestations of public rejoicing...John declared that these proceedings reflected dishonor on the church.”[4] According to Sozomen, John had also condemned the empress for her grandiose style of ruling over the empire and condemned her in the church, this of course enraged the empress and John was immediately disposed of. Later in life, Pulcheria would bring back the remains of John Chrysostom and make them into relics for the church, in gratitude for his pious life.[5] Eudoxia died in 404 and the emperor Arcadius died in 408. The emperor left behind four young children, including a seven-year-old Theodosius II. Theodosius was made emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire in 408, immediately after his father died. Two praetorian prefects were selected as regents over Theodosius, one being Anthemius and the other, Antiochus; both took over as regent. Eventually Pulcheria herself would take over as regent for her brother.The Emperors Guardian[edit]Once Pulcheria came of age, at fifteen, she felt, like her brother, that her family had no need for Antiochus any longer; her brother dismissed him of his duties. She then became her own brother’s regent: “In 412 Pulcheria quarreled with Antiochus, who like Anthemius had served the dynasty faithfully for a number of years, and induced her brother to dismiss him from the duties of praepositus. She then took personal charge of the imperial family, directing its affairs with such authority that she became known in society at large as the emperor’s guardian.”[6] Immediately when Pulcheria took authority over the imperial palace, the palace took on a much more monastic tone compared to that of her mother’s palace. Sozomen describes Pulcheria’s and her sisters pious ways in his Ecclesiastical History: “They all pursue the same mode of life; they are sedulous in their attendance in the house of prayer, and evince great charity towards strangers and the poor...and pass their days and their nights together in singing the praises of God.”[7] Rituals within the imperial palace also included chanting and reciting passages in the scripture, and fasting twice a week.[6] The sisters were known to have given up luxurious jewelry and apparel worn by most women of the imperial court of the past. Pulcheria also took on the role of providing all the training necessary for Theodosius to become a successful emperor, once he came of age. Although the empire was technically to be ruled by Theodosius II when he would come of age, his older sister Pulcheria exercised such profound influence over him all his life that she must be considered the co-regent of the empire until her death in 453. In fact it can be said without exaggeration that Pulcheria gave the identity to her brothers reign.[8] Pulcherias training of Theodosius included, ...how an Emperor must walk, and ride his horse, alone or in procession; how he should sit upon his throne: how to wear his Imperial armor and robes; and how to speak with dignity. By no means must he yield to loud laughter...[9] Not only did Pulcheria train her brother on the duties and customs of becoming an Emperor, but she also made sure Theodosius was trained to be a pious Christian leader. Once Theodosius came of age to rule as sole Emperor, according to many historians, the teachings of his sister had been ignored. “He was by nature kind, affable, easily led...Not only was he foolishly kind; he was careless, and often he was to neglect his duty in the administration of his Empire.”[10] This lack of power that Theodosius exemplified led to Pulcheria taking on a much larger role of authority and influence in the Empire.Vow of virginity[edit]At the same time Pulcheria proclaimed herself as guardian over her brother she also took a vow of virginity, and her sisters did as well.

Once Theodosius came of age to rule as sole Emperor, according to many historians, the teachings of his sister had been ignored. “He was by nature kind, affable, easily led...Not only was he foolishly kind; he was careless, and often he was to neglect his duty in the administration of his Empire.”[10] This lack of power that Theodosius exemplified led to Pulcheria taking on a much larger role of authority and influence in the Empire.Vow of virginity[edit]At the same time Pulcheria proclaimed herself as guardian over her brother she also took a vow of virginity, and her sisters did as well. Pulcheria’s reason for a vow of virginity may have been her deeply religious virtue as recorded by Sozomen: “She devoted her virginity to God, and instructed her sisters to do likewise. To avoid cause of scandal and opportunities for intrigue, she permitted no man to enter her palace. In confirmation of her resolution she took God, the priests, and all the subjects of the Roman empire as witnesses...”[11] Another contemporary of Pulcheria had also described her deep piety. In a letter from Pope Leo I to Pulcheria, he compliments her on her deeply religious ways: In it you clearly show how much you love the Catholic faith and how much you despise the errors of heretics.[12] Along with being deeply pious, it is possible that Pulcheria may have had other motives to take a vow of virginity. According to ancient historians Sozomen, Socrates, and Theodoret, Pulcheria had a deep dislike for Anthemius, the former guardian of Theodosius;[13] the reasons may have been his distaste for her immense power within the empire and her unwillingness to allow Anthemius to gain power amongst the imperial court. A more recent historian, Kenneth Holum, states that Anthemius had tried to make family ties between himself and the imperial family: “Married long since and many years Pulcheria’s senior, Anthemis naturally proposed a descendent or close relative, a grandson perhaps...born a few years earlier than Pulcheria and an excellent prospect for her hand”[14] Pulcheria had found herself in a position where she would have to give her power up to her potential husband, for once a woman in the imperial court married her power was to be relinquished to her husband. In order for Pulcheria to keep her power within the imperial court she took a vow of virginity to ensure that another man could not share her power.Augusta[edit]In 414 the Roman senate made Pulcheria Augusta. During her time as Augusta, Pulcheria held a great deal of power in politics and although she was a woman was treated equally among other men of power. In the senate of Constantinople lay a bust in her honor along with the other Augusti.[15] Many important events occurred during her time as Augusta and her brothers reign as emperor; however, Pulcheria’s influence was mostly in the church. Pulcheria and her brother were known to have harbored anti Jewish sentiment, and both had started to enact laws against Jewish worship in the city of Constantinople. Before the reign of Theodosius II, synagogues were seen as private property and were protected by the imperial government. In Theodosius’s reign he enacted a law that forbade the construction of synagogues, and demanded the destruction of synagogues as well. Pulcheria and Theodosius also ordered that a group of Jews be killed after strife amongst Christians emerged in Palestine.[16] It was well known that Pulcheria had little respect for Jewish people, stemmed by her disapproval of Nestorian theological practices; Kenneth Holum writes “Pulcheria had long nursed a special hatred for Jews, and the Nestorian heresy, which appeared to contemporaries to be of Jewish origin; no doubt had served to confirm that hatred.”[17] Although Pulcheria was known to have strong feelings against pagans and Jews alike, she was known for her philanthropic spirit as well. She had built many churches in and around the city of Constantinople, she had also built many buildings for the poor in the city Sozomen writes that it would take too much time to describe all the churches Pulcheria built, as well as hospitals and inns for the poor.[18] Pulcherias building projects were so vast in Constantinople that a whole district was named in her honor called the Pulcherianai, Some of these establishments were extensive enough to give the names of their proprietors to entire quarters of the city such as the Marina quarter in the second region and the Pulcherianai in the eleventh.[19] As well as contributing to the city with new churches and districts, Pulcheria contributed significantly to the church by bringing back bishops or remains of bishops who had once been dismissed as relics to the church. Pope Leo I describes Pulcherias contributions to the church in a letter to her, ...the entire Roman Church is most grateful to you for all the works of your faith, whether having assisted envoys in every way with devoted affection and for having brought back the Catholic bishops who were ejected from their churches by an unjust sentence, or for having brought back with fitting honor to the church he governed so well the remains of Flavian of holy memory, an innocent and Catholic bishop.[20] Pulcherias time as Augusta was also marked with war and ongoing conflict with Persia. Pulcheria had inspired war against Persia when Persian King Yazdegerd I executed a Christian bishop who destroyed an Zoroastrian altar.[21] Under the influence of Pulcheria, Theodosius sent troops into battle against Persia, the fanaticism over the war by the people of the empire was described by Sozomen as ready to do anything for the sake of Christianity.[21] Pulcheria and Theodosius were victorious in their invasion of Persia, and according to historians Theodosius had credited his sisters vow of virginity as the reason for victory. Surviving letters identify the source of that victory through the vows of his sisters. In his view, when Pulcheria devoted her virginity to God and imposed the same vow on her sisters, she secured Gods favor, causing every threat and war raised against her brother to disperse spontaneously.[22] Theodosius had made his sisters virginity a tool of war propaganda, and because of her vow to be faithful only to God the hand of God would help Roman troops in battle against Persia. Pulcherias power would become even greater after the death of her brother Theodosius II.Aelia Pulcheria (January 19, 398 or 399 – 453) was the daughter of Eastern Roman Emperor Arcadius and Empress Aelia Eudoxia. She was the second child born to Arcadius and Eudoxia. Her older sister was Flaccilla, who was born in 397 but is assumed to have died young. Her younger siblings were Arcadia, born in 400, Theodosius II, the future emperor, and Marina, both born in 401.[1] When her father Arcadius died in 408, her brother Theodosius II was made Emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire, at seven years old. On July 4, 414 a fifteen-year-old Pulcheria proclaimed herself regent over her brother, then thirteen years of age, and made herself Augusta and Empress of the Eastern Roman Empire. According to the ancient historian Sozomen, in his Ecclesiastical History, Pulcheria took a vow of virginity when she became Augusta, and her sisters followed suit. Theodosius II died on July 26, 450, and Pulcheria soon married Marcian on November 25, 450. Marcian and Pulcheria were proclaimed Emperor and Empress of the Eastern Roman Empire. Three years later, in July 453, Pulcheria died; she was later made a saint by the Church.[2] Pulcheria is known to have held a significant amount of power in her brothers reign as emperor. Pulcheria was also of great influence over the church and theological practices of this time. She had influence over anti-pagan policies, church building projects, and the debate over the Marian title Theotokos (Birth-giver to God).Contents  [hide] 1 Biography1.1 Early life1.2 The Emperors Guardian1.3 Vow of virginity1.4 Augusta1.5 Empress1.5.1 Church conflict1.6 Death2 Relationship with Aelia Eudocia3 Influence over the church4 See also5 Notes6 ReferencesBiography[edit]Early life[edit]Pulcheria was born into the royal House of Theodosius, a dynasty of the later Roman empire, ruling in Constantinople. Her father was Arcadius, and her mother was Aelia Eudoxia. Like Pulcheria, her mother was also powerful and of great influence over the church, however not in the same way Pulcheria was. Arcadius reign was marked by the conflict between his wife and the Bishop of Constantinople,“Although his reign (Arcadius) was short, it is remembered in part for the controversial conflicts Eudoxia encountered with John Chrysostom, bishop of Constantinople from 398 to 404.[3] According to the ancient historian Sozomen, in his Ecclesiastical History, Sozomen claims that much of the rivalry was based on an ornate statue made in the honor of Eudoxia which Chrysostom condemned, “The silver statue of the empress...was placed upon a column of porphyry; and the event was celebrated by loud acclamations, dancing, games, and other manifestations of public rejoicing...John declared that these proceedings reflected dishonor on the church.”[4] According to Sozomen, John had also condemned the empress for her grandiose style of ruling over the empire and condemned her in the church, this of course enraged the empress and John was immediately disposed of. Later in life, Pulcheria would bring back the remains of John Chrysostom and make them into relics for the church, in gratitude for his pious life.[5] Eudoxia died in 404 and the emperor Arcadius died in 408. The emperor left behind four young children, including a seven-year-old Theodosius II. Theodosius was made emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire in 408, immediately after his father died. Two praetorian prefects were selected as regents over Theodosius, one being Anthemius and the other, Antiochus; both took over as regent. Eventually Pulcheria herself would take over as regent for her brother.The Emperors Guardian[edit]Once Pulcheria came of age, at fifteen, she felt, like her brother, that her family had no need for Antiochus any longer; her brother dismissed him of his duties. She then became her own brother’s regent: “In 412 Pulcheria quarreled with Antiochus, who like Anthemius had served the dynasty faithfully for a number of years, and induced her brother to dismiss him from the duties of praepositus. She then took personal charge of the imperial family, directing its affairs with such authority that she became known in society at large as the emperor’s guardian.”[6] Immediately when Pulcheria took authority over the imperial palace, the palace took on a much more monastic tone compared to that of her mother’s palace. Sozomen describes Pulcheria’s and her sisters pious ways in his Ecclesiastical History: “They all pursue the same mode of life; they are sedulous in their attendance in the house of prayer, and evince great charity towards strangers and the poor...and pass their days and their nights together in singing the praises of God.”[7] Rituals within the imperial palace also included chanting and reciting passages in the scripture, and fasting twice a week.[6] The sisters were known to have given up luxurious jewelry and apparel worn by most women of the imperial court of the past. Pulcheria also took on the role of providing all the training necessary for Theodosius to become a successful emperor, once he came of age. Although the empire was technically to be ruled by Theodosius II when he would come of age, his older sister Pulcheria exercised such profound influence over him all his life that she must be considered the co-regent of the empire until her death in 453. In fact it can be said without exaggeration that Pulcheria gave the identity to her brothers reign.[8] Pulcherias training of Theodosius included, ...how an Emperor must walk, and ride his horse, alone or in procession; how he should sit upon his throne: how to wear his Imperial armor and robes; and how to speak with dignity.

In fact it can be said without exaggeration that Pulcheria gave the identity to her brothers reign.[8] Pulcherias training of Theodosius included, ...how an Emperor must walk, and ride his horse, alone or in procession; how he should sit upon his throne: how to wear his Imperial armor and robes; and how to speak with dignity. By no means must he yield to loud laughter...[9] Not only did Pulcheria train her brother on the duties and customs of becoming an Emperor, but she also made sure Theodosius was trained to be a pious Christian leader. Once Theodosius came of age to rule as sole Emperor, according to many historians, the teachings of his sister had been ignored. “He was by nature kind, affable, easily led...Not only was he foolishly kind; he was careless, and often he was to neglect his duty in the administration of his Empire.”[10] This lack of power that Theodosius exemplified led to Pulcheria taking on a much larger role of authority and influence in the Empire.Vow of virginity[edit]At the same time Pulcheria proclaimed herself as guardian over her brother she also took a vow of virginity, and her sisters did as well. Pulcheria’s reason for a vow of virginity may have been her deeply religious virtue as recorded by Sozomen: “She devoted her virginity to God, and instructed her sisters to do likewise. To avoid cause of scandal and opportunities for intrigue, she permitted no man to enter her palace. In confirmation of her resolution she took God, the priests, and all the subjects of the Roman empire as witnesses...”[11] Another contemporary of Pulcheria had also described her deep piety. In a letter from Pope Leo I to Pulcheria, he compliments her on her deeply religious ways: In it you clearly show how much you love the Catholic faith and how much you despise the errors of heretics.[12] Along with being deeply pious, it is possible that Pulcheria may have had other motives to take a vow of virginity. According to ancient historians Sozomen, Socrates, and Theodoret, Pulcheria had a deep dislike for Anthemius, the former guardian of Theodosius;[13] the reasons may have been his distaste for her immense power within the empire and her unwillingness to allow Anthemius to gain power amongst the imperial court. A more recent historian, Kenneth Holum, states that Anthemius had tried to make family ties between himself and the imperial family: “Married long since and many years Pulcheria’s senior, Anthemis naturally proposed a descendent or close relative, a grandson perhaps...born a few years earlier than Pulcheria and an excellent prospect for her hand”[14] Pulcheria had found herself in a position where she would have to give her power up to her potential husband, for once a woman in the imperial court married her power was to be relinquished to her husband. In order for Pulcheria to keep her power within the imperial court she took a vow of virginity to ensure that another man could not share her power.Augusta[edit]In 414 the Roman senate made Pulcheria Augusta. During her time as Augusta, Pulcheria held a great deal of power in politics and although she was a woman was treated equally among other men of power. In the senate of Constantinople lay a bust in her honor along with the other Augusti.[15] Many important events occurred during her time as Augusta and her brothers reign as emperor; however, Pulcheria’s influence was mostly in the church. Pulcheria and her brother were known to have harbored anti Jewish sentiment, and both had started to enact laws against Jewish worship in the city of Constantinople. Before the reign of Theodosius II, synagogues were seen as private property and were protected by the imperial government. In Theodosius’s reign he enacted a law that forbade the construction of synagogues, and demanded the destruction of synagogues as well. Pulcheria and Theodosius also ordered that a group of Jews be killed after strife amongst Christians emerged in Palestine.[16] It was well known that Pulcheria had little respect for Jewish people, stemmed by her disapproval of Nestorian theological practices; Kenneth Holum writes “Pulcheria had long nursed a special hatred for Jews, and the Nestorian heresy, which appeared to contemporaries to be of Jewish origin; no doubt had served to confirm that hatred.”[17] Although Pulcheria was known to have strong feelings against pagans and Jews alike, she was known for her philanthropic spirit as well. She had built many churches in and around the city of Constantinople, she had also built many buildings for the poor in the city Sozomen writes that it would take too much time to describe all the churches Pulcheria built, as well as hospitals and inns for the poor.[18] Pulcherias building projects were so vast in Constantinople that a whole district was named in her honor called the Pulcherianai, Some of these establishments were extensive enough to give the names of their proprietors to entire quarters of the city such as the Marina quarter in the second region and the Pulcherianai in the eleventh.[19] As well as contributing to the city with new churches and districts, Pulcheria contributed significantly to the church by bringing back bishops or remains of bishops who had once been dismissed as relics to the church. Pope Leo I describes Pulcherias contributions to the church in a letter to her, ...the entire Roman Church is most grateful to you for all the works of your faith, whether having assisted envoys in every way with devoted affection and for having brought back the Catholic bishops who were ejected from their churches by an unjust sentence, or for having brought back with fitting honor to the church he governed so well the remains of Flavian of holy memory, an innocent and Catholic bishop.[20] Pulcherias time as Augusta was also marked with war and ongoing conflict with Persia. Pulcheria had inspired war against Persia when Persian King Yazdegerd I executed a Christian bishop who destroyed an Zoroastrian altar.[21] Under the influence of Pulcheria, Theodosius sent troops into battle against Persia, the fanaticism over the war by the people of the empire was described by Sozomen as ready to do anything for the sake of Christianity.[21] Pulcheria and Theodosius were victorious in their invasion of Persia, and according to historians Theodosius had credited his sisters vow of virginity as the reason for victory. Surviving letters identify the source of that victory through the vows of his sisters. In his view, when Pulcheria devoted her virginity to God and imposed the same vow on her sisters, she secured Gods favor, causing every threat and war raised against her brother to disperse spontaneously.[22] Theodosius had made his sisters virginity a tool of war propaganda, and because of her vow to be faithful only to God the hand of God would help Roman troops in battle against Persia. Pulcherias power would become even greater after the death of her brother Theodosius II.Aelia Pulcheria (January 19, 398 or 399 – 453) was the daughter of Eastern Roman Emperor Arcadius and Empress Aelia Eudoxia. She was the second child born to Arcadius and Eudoxia. Her older sister was Flaccilla, who was born in 397 but is assumed to have died young. Her younger siblings were Arcadia, born in 400, Theodosius II, the future emperor, and Marina, both born in 401.[1] When her father Arcadius died in 408, her brother Theodosius II was made Emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire, at seven years old. On July 4, 414 a fifteen-year-old Pulcheria proclaimed herself regent over her brother, then thirteen years of age, and made herself Augusta and Empress of the Eastern Roman Empire. According to the ancient historian Sozomen, in his Ecclesiastical History, Pulcheria took a vow of virginity when she became Augusta, and her sisters followed suit. Theodosius II died on July 26, 450, and Pulcheria soon married Marcian on November 25, 450. Marcian and Pulcheria were proclaimed Emperor and Empress of the Eastern Roman Empire. Three years later, in July 453, Pulcheria died; she was later made a saint by the Church.[2] Pulcheria is known to have held a significant amount of power in her brothers reign as emperor. Pulcheria was also of great influence over the church and theological practices of this time. She had influence over anti-pagan policies, church building projects, and the debate over the Marian title Theotokos (Birth-giver to God).Contents  [hide] 1 Biography1.1 Early life1.2 The Emperors Guardian1.3 Vow of virginity1.4 Augusta1.5 Empress1.5.1 Church conflict1.6 Death2 Relationship with Aelia Eudocia3 Influence over the church4 See also5 Notes6 ReferencesBiography[edit]Early life[edit]Pulcheria was born into the royal House of Theodosius, a dynasty of the later Roman empire, ruling in Constantinople. Her father was Arcadius, and her mother was Aelia Eudoxia. Like Pulcheria, her mother was also powerful and of great influence over the church, however not in the same way Pulcheria was. Arcadius reign was marked by the conflict between his wife and the Bishop of Constantinople,“Although his reign (Arcadius) was short, it is remembered in part for the controversial conflicts Eudoxia encountered with John Chrysostom, bishop of Constantinople from 398 to 404.[3] According to the ancient historian Sozomen, in his Ecclesiastical History, Sozomen claims that much of the rivalry was based on an ornate statue made in the honor of Eudoxia which Chrysostom condemned, “The silver statue of the empress...was placed upon a column of porphyry; and the event was celebrated by loud acclamations, dancing, games, and other manifestations of public rejoicing...John declared that these proceedings reflected dishonor on the church.”[4] According to Sozomen, John had also condemned the empress for her grandiose style of ruling over the empire and condemned her in the church, this of course enraged the empress and John was immediately disposed of. Later in life, Pulcheria would bring back the remains of John Chrysostom and make them into relics for the church, in gratitude for his pious life.[5] Eudoxia died in 404 and the emperor Arcadius died in 408. The emperor left behind four young children, including a seven-year-old Theodosius II. Theodosius was made emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire in 408, immediately after his father died. Two praetorian prefects were selected as regents over Theodosius, one being Anthemius and the other, Antiochus; both took over as regent. Eventually Pulcheria herself would take over as regent for her brother.The Emperors Guardian[edit]Once Pulcheria came of age, at fifteen, she felt, like her brother, that her family had no need for Antiochus any longer; her brother dismissed him of his duties. She then became her own brother’s regent: “In 412 Pulcheria quarreled with Antiochus, who like Anthemius had served the dynasty faithfully for a number of years, and induced her brother to dismiss him from the duties of praepositus. She then took personal charge of the imperial family, directing its affairs with such authority that she became known in society at large as the emperor’s guardian.”[6] Immediately when Pulcheria took authority over the imperial palace, the palace took on a much more monastic tone compared to that of her mother’s palace. Sozomen describes Pulcheria’s and her sisters pious ways in his Ecclesiastical History: “They all pursue the same mode of life; they are sedulous in their attendance in the house of prayer, and evince great charity towards strangers and the poor...and pass their days and their nights together in singing the praises of God.”[7] Rituals within the imperial palace also included chanting and reciting passages in the scripture, and fasting twice a week.[6] The sisters were known to have given up luxurious jewelry and apparel worn by most women of the imperial court of the past. Pulcheria also took on the role of providing all the training necessary for Theodosius to become a successful emperor, once he came of age. Although the empire was technically to be ruled by Theodosius II when he would come of age, his older sister Pulcheria exercised such profound influence over him all his life that she must be considered the co-regent of the empire until her death in 453.

Although the empire was technically to be ruled by Theodosius II when he would come of age, his older sister Pulcheria exercised such profound influence over him all his life that she must be considered the co-regent of the empire until her death in 453. In fact it can be said without exaggeration that Pulcheria gave the identity to her brothers reign.[8] Pulcherias training of Theodosius included, ...how an Emperor must walk, and ride his horse, alone or in procession; how he should sit upon his throne: how to wear his Imperial armor and robes; and how to speak with dignity. By no means must he yield to loud laughter...[9] Not only did Pulcheria train her brother on the duties and customs of becoming an Emperor, but she also made sure Theodosius was trained to be a pious Christian leader. Once Theodosius came of age to rule as sole Emperor, according to many historians, the teachings of his sister had been ignored. “He was by nature kind, affable, easily led...Not only was he foolishly kind; he was careless, and often he was to neglect his duty in the administration of his Empire.”[10] This lack of power that Theodosius exemplified led to Pulcheria taking on a much larger role of authority and influence in the Empire.Vow of virginity[edit]At the same time Pulcheria proclaimed herself as guardian over her brother she also took a vow of virginity, and her sisters did as well. Pulcheria’s reason for a vow of virginity may have been her deeply religious virtue as recorded by Sozomen: “She devoted her virginity to God, and instructed her sisters to do likewise. To avoid cause of scandal and opportunities for intrigue, she permitted no man to enter her palace. In confirmation of her resolution she took God, the priests, and all the subjects of the Roman empire as witnesses...”[11] Another contemporary of Pulcheria had also described her deep piety. In a letter from Pope Leo I to Pulcheria, he compliments her on her deeply religious ways: In it you clearly show how much you love the Catholic faith and how much you despise the errors of heretics.[12] Along with being deeply pious, it is possible that Pulcheria may have had other motives to take a vow of virginity. According to ancient historians Sozomen, Socrates, and Theodoret, Pulcheria had a deep dislike for Anthemius, the former guardian of Theodosius;[13] the reasons may have been his distaste for her immense power within the empire and her unwillingness to allow Anthemius to gain power amongst the imperial court. A more recent historian, Kenneth Holum, states that Anthemius had tried to make family ties between himself and the imperial family: “Married long since and many years Pulcheria’s senior, Anthemis naturally proposed a descendent or close relative, a grandson perhaps...born a few years earlier than Pulcheria and an excellent prospect for her hand”[14] Pulcheria had found herself in a position where she would have to give her power up to her potential husband, for once a woman in the imperial court married her power was to be relinquished to her husband. In order for Pulcheria to keep her power within the imperial court she took a vow of virginity to ensure that another man could not share her power.Augusta[edit]In 414 the Roman senate made Pulcheria Augusta. During her time as Augusta, Pulcheria held a great deal of power in politics and although she was a woman was treated equally among other men of power. In the senate of Constantinople lay a bust in her honor along with the other Augusti.[15] Many important events occurred during her time as Augusta and her brothers reign as emperor; however, Pulcheria’s influence was mostly in the church. Pulcheria and her brother were known to have harbored anti Jewish sentiment, and both had started to enact laws against Jewish worship in the city of Constantinople. Before the reign of Theodosius II, synagogues were seen as private property and were protected by the imperial government. In Theodosius’s reign he enacted a law that forbade the construction of synagogues, and demanded the destruction of synagogues as well. Pulcheria and Theodosius also ordered that a group of Jews be killed after strife amongst Christians emerged in Palestine.[16] It was well known that Pulcheria had little respect for Jewish people, stemmed by her disapproval of Nestorian theological practices; Kenneth Holum writes “Pulcheria had long nursed a special hatred for Jews, and the Nestorian heresy, which appeared to contemporaries to be of Jewish origin; no doubt had served to confirm that hatred.”[17] Although Pulcheria was known to have strong feelings against pagans and Jews alike, she was known for her philanthropic spirit as well. She had built many churches in and around the city of Constantinople, she had also built many buildings for the poor in the city Sozomen writes that it would take too much time to describe all the churches Pulcheria built, as well as hospitals and inns for the poor.[18] Pulcherias building projects were so vast in Constantinople that a whole district was named in her honor called the Pulcherianai, Some of these establishments were extensive enough to give the names of their proprietors to entire quarters of the city such as the Marina quarter in the second region and the Pulcherianai in the eleventh.[19] As well as contributing to the city with new churches and districts, Pulcheria contributed significantly to the church by bringing back bishops or remains of bishops who had once been dismissed as relics to the church. Pope Leo I describes Pulcherias contributions to the church in a letter to her, ...the entire Roman Church is most grateful to you for all the works of your faith, whether having assisted envoys in every way with devoted affection and for having brought back the Catholic bishops who were ejected from their churches by an unjust sentence, or for having brought back with fitting honor to the church he governed so well the remains of Flavian of holy memory, an innocent and Catholic bishop.[20] Pulcherias time as Augusta was also marked with war and ongoing conflict with Persia. Pulcheria had inspired war against Persia when Persian King Yazdegerd I executed a Christian bishop who destroyed an Zoroastrian altar.[21] Under the influence of Pulcheria, Theodosius sent troops into battle against Persia, the fanaticism over the war by the people of the empire was described by Sozomen as ready to do anything for the sake of Christianity.[21] Pulcheria and Theodosius were victorious in their invasion of Persia, and according to historians Theodosius had credited his sisters vow of virginity as the reason for victory. Surviving letters identify the source of that victory through the vows of his sisters. In his view, when Pulcheria devoted her virginity to God and imposed the same vow on her sisters, she secured Gods favor, causing every threat and war raised against her brother to disperse spontaneously.[22] Theodosius had made his sisters virginity a tool of war propaganda, and because of her vow to be faithful only to God the hand of God would help Roman troops in battle against Persia. Pulcherias power would become even greater after the death of her brother Theodosius II.Aelia Pulcheria (January 19, 398 or 399 – 453) was the daughter of Eastern Roman Emperor Arcadius and Empress Aelia Eudoxia. She was the second child born to Arcadius and Eudoxia. Her older sister was Flaccilla, who was born in 397 but is assumed to have died young. Her younger siblings were Arcadia, born in 400, Theodosius II, the future emperor, and Marina, both born in 401.[1] When her father Arcadius died in 408, her brother Theodosius II was made Emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire, at seven years old. On July 4, 414 a fifteen-year-old Pulcheria proclaimed herself regent over her brother, then thirteen years of age, and made herself Augusta and Empress of the Eastern Roman Empire. According to the ancient historian Sozomen, in his Ecclesiastical History, Pulcheria took a vow of virginity when she became Augusta, and her sisters followed suit. Theodosius II died on July 26, 450, and Pulcheria soon married Marcian on November 25, 450. Marcian and Pulcheria were proclaimed Emperor and Empress of the Eastern Roman Empire. Three years later, in July 453, Pulcheria died; she was later made a saint by the Church.[2] Pulcheria is known to have held a significant amount of power in her brothers reign as emperor. Pulcheria was also of great influence over the church and theological practices of this time. She had influence over anti-pagan policies, church building projects, and the debate over the Marian title Theotokos (Birth-giver to God).Contents  [hide] 1 Biography1.1 Early life1.2 The Emperors Guardian1.3 Vow of virginity1.4 Augusta1.5 Empress1.5.1 Church conflict1.6 Death2 Relationship with Aelia Eudocia3 Influence over the church4 See also5 Notes6 ReferencesBiography[edit]Early life[edit]Pulcheria was born into the royal House of Theodosius, a dynasty of the later Roman empire, ruling in Constantinople. Her father was Arcadius, and her mother was Aelia Eudoxia. Like Pulcheria, her mother was also powerful and of great influence over the church, however not in the same way Pulcheria was. Arcadius reign was marked by the conflict between his wife and the Bishop of Constantinople,“Although his reign (Arcadius) was short, it is remembered in part for the controversial conflicts Eudoxia encountered with John Chrysostom, bishop of Constantinople from 398 to 404.[3] According to the ancient historian Sozomen, in his Ecclesiastical History, Sozomen claims that much of the rivalry was based on an ornate statue made in the honor of Eudoxia which Chrysostom condemned, “The silver statue of the empress...was placed upon a column of porphyry; and the event was celebrated by loud acclamations, dancing, games, and other manifestations of public rejoicing...John declared that these proceedings reflected dishonor on the church.”[4] According to Sozomen, John had also condemned the empress for her grandiose style of ruling over the empire and condemned her in the church, this of course enraged the empress and John was immediately disposed of. Later in life, Pulcheria would bring back the remains of John Chrysostom and make them into relics for the church, in gratitude for his pious life.[5] Eudoxia died in 404 and the emperor Arcadius died in 408. The emperor left behind four young children, including a seven-year-old Theodosius II. Theodosius was made emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire in 408, immediately after his father died. Two praetorian prefects were selected as regents over Theodosius, one being Anthemius and the other, Antiochus; both took over as regent. Eventually Pulcheria herself would take over as regent for her brother.The Emperors Guardian[edit]Once Pulcheria came of age, at fifteen, she felt, like her brother, that her family had no need for Antiochus any longer; her brother dismissed him of his duties. She then became her own brother’s regent: “In 412 Pulcheria quarreled with Antiochus, who like Anthemius had served the dynasty faithfully for a number of years, and induced her brother to dismiss him from the duties of praepositus. She then took personal charge of the imperial family, directing its affairs with such authority that she became known in society at large as the emperor’s guardian.”[6] Immediately when Pulcheria took authority over the imperial palace, the palace took on a much more monastic tone compared to that of her mother’s palace. Sozomen describes Pulcheria’s and her sisters pious ways in his Ecclesiastical History: “They all pursue the same mode of life; they are sedulous in their attendance in the house of prayer, and evince great charity towards strangers and the poor...and pass their days and their nights together in singing the praises of God.”[7] Rituals within the imperial palace also included chanting and reciting passages in the scripture, and fasting twice a week.[6] The sisters were known to have given up luxurious jewelry and apparel worn by most women of the imperial court of the past.

Sozomen describes Pulcheria’s and her sisters pious ways in his Ecclesiastical History: “They all pursue the same mode of life; they are sedulous in their attendance in the house of prayer, and evince great charity towards strangers and the poor...and pass their days and their nights together in singing the praises of God.”[7] Rituals within the imperial palace also included chanting and reciting passages in the scripture, and fasting twice a week.[6] The sisters were known to have given up luxurious jewelry and apparel worn by most women of the imperial court of the past. Pulcheria also took on the role of providing all the training necessary for Theodosius to become a successful emperor, once he came of age. Although the empire was technically to be ruled by Theodosius II when he would come of age, his older sister Pulcheria exercised such profound influence over him all his life that she must be considered the co-regent of the empire until her death in 453. In fact it can be said without exaggeration that Pulcheria gave the identity to her brothers reign.[8] Pulcherias training of Theodosius included, ...how an Emperor must walk, and ride his horse, alone or in procession; how he should sit upon his throne: how to wear his Imperial armor and robes; and how to speak with dignity. By no means must he yield to loud laughter...[9] Not only did Pulcheria train her brother on the duties and customs of becoming an Emperor, but she also made sure Theodosius was trained to be a pious Christian leader. Once Theodosius came of age to rule as sole Emperor, according to many historians, the teachings of his sister had been ignored. “He was by nature kind, affable, easily led...Not only was he foolishly kind; he was careless, and often he was to neglect his duty in the administration of his Empire.”[10] This lack of power that Theodosius exemplified led to Pulcheria taking on a much larger role of authority and influence in the Empire.Vow of virginity[edit]At the same time Pulcheria proclaimed herself as guardian over her brother she also took a vow of virginity, and her sisters did as well. Pulcheria’s reason for a vow of virginity may have been her deeply religious virtue as recorded by Sozomen: “She devoted her virginity to God, and instructed her sisters to do likewise. To avoid cause of scandal and opportunities for intrigue, she permitted no man to enter her palace. In confirmation of her resolution she took God, the priests, and all the subjects of the Roman empire as witnesses...”[11] Another contemporary of Pulcheria had also described her deep piety. In a letter from Pope Leo I to Pulcheria, he compliments her on her deeply religious ways: In it you clearly show how much you love the Catholic faith and how much you despise the errors of heretics.[12] Along with being deeply pious, it is possible that Pulcheria may have had other motives to take a vow of virginity. According to ancient historians Sozomen, Socrates, and Theodoret, Pulcheria had a deep dislike for Anthemius, the former guardian of Theodosius;[13] the reasons may have been his distaste for her immense power within the empire and her unwillingness to allow Anthemius to gain power amongst the imperial court. A more recent historian, Kenneth Holum, states that Anthemius had tried to make family ties between himself and the imperial family: “Married long since and many years Pulcheria’s senior, Anthemis naturally proposed a descendent or close relative, a grandson perhaps...born a few years earlier than Pulcheria and an excellent prospect for her hand”[14] Pulcheria had found herself in a position where she would have to give her power up to her potential husband, for once a woman in the imperial court married her power was to be relinquished to her husband. In order for Pulcheria to keep her power within the imperial court she took a vow of virginity to ensure that another man could not share her power.Augusta[edit]In 414 the Roman senate made Pulcheria Augusta. During her time as Augusta, Pulcheria held a great deal of power in politics and although she was a woman was treated equally among other men of power. In the senate of Constantinople lay a bust in her honor along with the other Augusti.[15] Many important events occurred during her time as Augusta and her brothers reign as emperor; however, Pulcheria’s influence was mostly in the church. Pulcheria and her brother were known to have harbored anti Jewish sentiment, and both had started to enact laws against Jewish worship in the city of Constantinople. Before the reign of Theodosius II, synagogues were seen as private property and were protected by the imperial government. In Theodosius’s reign he enacted a law that forbade the construction of synagogues, and demanded the destruction of synagogues as well. Pulcheria and Theodosius also ordered that a group of Jews be killed after strife amongst Christians emerged in Palestine.[16] It was well known that Pulcheria had little respect for Jewish people, stemmed by her disapproval of Nestorian theological practices; Kenneth Holum writes “Pulcheria had long nursed a special hatred for Jews, and the Nestorian heresy, which appeared to contemporaries to be of Jewish origin; no doubt had served to confirm that hatred.”[17] Although Pulcheria was known to have strong feelings against pagans and Jews alike, she was known for her philanthropic spirit as well. She had built many churches in and around the city of Constantinople, she had also built many buildings for the poor in the city Sozomen writes that it would take too much time to describe all the churches Pulcheria built, as well as hospitals and inns for the poor.[18] Pulcherias building projects were so vast in Constantinople that a whole district was named in her honor called the Pulcherianai, Some of these establishments were extensive enough to give the names of their proprietors to entire quarters of the city such as the Marina quarter in the second region and the Pulcherianai in the eleventh.[19] As well as contributing to the city with new churches and districts, Pulcheria contributed significantly to the church by bringing back bishops or remains of bishops who had once been dismissed as relics to the church. Pope Leo I describes Pulcherias contributions to the church in a letter to her, ...the entire Roman Church is most grateful to you for all the works of your faith, whether having assisted envoys in every way with devoted affection and for having brought back the Catholic bishops who were ejected from their churches by an unjust sentence, or for having brought back with fitting honor to the church he governed so well the remains of Flavian of holy memory, an innocent and Catholic bishop.[20] Pulcherias time as Augusta was also marked with war and ongoing conflict with Persia. Pulcheria had inspired war against Persia when Persian King Yazdegerd I executed a Christian bishop who destroyed an Zoroastrian altar.[21] Under the influence of Pulcheria, Theodosius sent troops into battle against Persia, the fanaticism over the war by the people of the empire was described by Sozomen as ready to do anything for the sake of Christianity.[21] Pulcheria and Theodosius were victorious in their invasion of Persia, and according to historians Theodosius had credited his sisters vow of virginity as the reason for victory. Surviving letters identify the source of that victory through the vows of his sisters. In his view, when Pulcheria devoted her virginity to God and imposed the same vow on her sisters, she secured Gods favor, causing every threat and war raised against her brother to disperse spontaneously.[22] Theodosius had made his sisters virginity a tool of war propaganda, and because of her vow to be faithful only to God the hand of God would help Roman troops in battle against Persia. Pulcherias power would become even greater after the death of her brother Theodosius II.Aelia Pulcheria (January 19, 398 or 399 – 453) was the daughter of Eastern Roman Emperor Arcadius and Empress Aelia Eudoxia. She was the second child born to Arcadius and Eudoxia. Her older sister was Flaccilla, who was born in 397 but is assumed to have died young. Her younger siblings were Arcadia, born in 400, Theodosius II, the future emperor, and Marina, both born in 401.[1] When her father Arcadius died in 408, her brother Theodosius II was made Emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire, at seven years old. On July 4, 414 a fifteen-year-old Pulcheria proclaimed herself regent over her brother, then thirteen years of age, and made herself Augusta and Empress of the Eastern Roman Empire. According to the ancient historian Sozomen, in his Ecclesiastical History, Pulcheria took a vow of virginity when she became Augusta, and her sisters followed suit. Theodosius II died on July 26, 450, and Pulcheria soon married Marcian on November 25, 450. Marcian and Pulcheria were proclaimed Emperor and Empress of the Eastern Roman Empire. Three years later, in July 453, Pulcheria died; she was later made a saint by the Church.[2] Pulcheria is known to have held a significant amount of power in her brothers reign as emperor. Pulcheria was also of great influence over the church and theological practices of this time. She had influence over anti-pagan policies, church building projects, and the debate over the Marian title Theotokos (Birth-giver to God).Contents  [hide] 1 Biography1.1 Early life1.2 The Emperors Guardian1.3 Vow of virginity1.4 Augusta1.5 Empress1.5.1 Church conflict1.6 Death2 Relationship with Aelia Eudocia3 Influence over the church4 See also5 Notes6 ReferencesBiography[edit]Early life[edit]Pulcheria was born into the royal House of Theodosius, a dynasty of the later Roman empire, ruling in Constantinople. Her father was Arcadius, and her mother was Aelia Eudoxia. Like Pulcheria, her mother was also powerful and of great influence over the church, however not in the same way Pulcheria was. Arcadius reign was marked by the conflict between his wife and the Bishop of Constantinople,“Although his reign (Arcadius) was short, it is remembered in part for the controversial conflicts Eudoxia encountered with John Chrysostom, bishop of Constantinople from 398 to 404.[3] According to the ancient historian Sozomen, in his Ecclesiastical History, Sozomen claims that much of the rivalry was based on an ornate statue made in the honor of Eudoxia which Chrysostom condemned, “The silver statue of the empress...was placed upon a column of porphyry; and the event was celebrated by loud acclamations, dancing, games, and other manifestations of public rejoicing...John declared that these proceedings reflected dishonor on the church.”[4] According to Sozomen, John had also condemned the empress for her grandiose style of ruling over the empire and condemned her in the church, this of course enraged the empress and John was immediately disposed of. Later in life, Pulcheria would bring back the remains of John Chrysostom and make them into relics for the church, in gratitude for his pious life.[5] Eudoxia died in 404 and the emperor Arcadius died in 408. The emperor left behind four young children, including a seven-year-old Theodosius II. Theodosius was made emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire in 408, immediately after his father died. Two praetorian prefects were selected as regents over Theodosius, one being Anthemius and the other, Antiochus; both took over as regent. Eventually Pulcheria herself would take over as regent for her brother.The Emperors Guardian[edit]Once Pulcheria came of age, at fifteen, she felt, like her brother, that her family had no need for Antiochus any longer; her brother dismissed him of his duties.

She then became her own brother’s regent: “In 412 Pulcheria quarreled with Antiochus, who like Anthemius had served the dynasty faithfully for a number of years, and induced her brother to dismiss him from the duties of praepositus. She then took personal charge of the imperial family, directing its affairs with such authority that she became known in society at large as the emperor’s guardian.”[6] Immediately when Pulcheria took authority over the imperial palace, the palace took on a much more monastic tone compared to that of her mother’s palace. Sozomen describes Pulcheria’s and her sisters pious ways in his Ecclesiastical History: “They all pursue the same mode of life; they are sedulous in their attendance in the house of prayer, and evince great charity towards strangers and the poor...and pass their days and their nights together in singing the praises of God.”[7] Rituals within the imperial palace also included chanting and reciting passages in the scripture, and fasting twice a week.[6] The sisters were known to have given up luxurious jewelry and apparel worn by most women of the imperial court of the past. Pulcheria also took on the role of providing all the training necessary for Theodosius to become a successful emperor, once he came of age. Although the empire was technically to be ruled by Theodosius II when he would come of age, his older sister Pulcheria exercised such profound influence over him all his life that she must be considered the co-regent of the empire until her death in 453. In fact it can be said without exaggeration that Pulcheria gave the identity to her brothers reign.[8] Pulcherias training of Theodosius included, ...how an Emperor must walk, and ride his horse, alone or in procession; how he should sit upon his throne: how to wear his Imperial armor and robes; and how to speak with dignity. By no means must he yield to loud laughter...[9] Not only did Pulcheria train her brother on the duties and customs of becoming an Emperor, but she also made sure Theodosius was trained to be a pious Christian leader. Once Theodosius came of age to rule as sole Emperor, according to many historians, the teachings of his sister had been ignored. “He was by nature kind, affable, easily led...Not only was he foolishly kind; he was careless, and often he was to neglect his duty in the administration of his Empire.”[10] This lack of power that Theodosius exemplified led to Pulcheria taking on a much larger role of authority and influence in the Empire.Vow of virginity[edit]At the same time Pulcheria proclaimed herself as guardian over her brother she also took a vow of virginity, and her sisters did as well. Pulcheria’s reason for a vow of virginity may have been her deeply religious virtue as recorded by Sozomen: “She devoted her virginity to God, and instructed her sisters to do likewise. To avoid cause of scandal and opportunities for intrigue, she permitted no man to enter her palace. In confirmation of her resolution she took God, the priests, and all the subjects of the Roman empire as witnesses...”[11] Another contemporary of Pulcheria had also described her deep piety. In a letter from Pope Leo I to Pulcheria, he compliments her on her deeply religious ways: In it you clearly show how much you love the Catholic faith and how much you despise the errors of heretics.[12] Along with being deeply pious, it is possible that Pulcheria may have had other motives to take a vow of virginity. According to ancient historians Sozomen, Socrates, and Theodoret, Pulcheria had a deep dislike for Anthemius, the former guardian of Theodosius;[13] the reasons may have been his distaste for her immense power within the empire and her unwillingness to allow Anthemius to gain power amongst the imperial court. A more recent historian, Kenneth Holum, states that Anthemius had tried to make family ties between himself and the imperial family: “Married long since and many years Pulcheria’s senior, Anthemis naturally proposed a descendent or close relative, a grandson perhaps...born a few years earlier than Pulcheria and an excellent prospect for her hand”[14] Pulcheria had found herself in a position where she would have to give her power up to her potential husband, for once a woman in the imperial court married her power was to be relinquished to her husband. In order for Pulcheria to keep her power within the imperial court she took a vow of virginity to ensure that another man could not share her power.Augusta[edit]In 414 the Roman senate made Pulcheria Augusta. During her time as Augusta, Pulcheria held a great deal of power in politics and although she was a woman was treated equally among other men of power. In the senate of Constantinople lay a bust in her honor along with the other Augusti.[15] Many important events occurred during her time as Augusta and her brothers reign as emperor; however, Pulcheria’s influence was mostly in the church. Pulcheria and her brother were known to have harbored anti Jewish sentiment, and both had started to enact laws against Jewish worship in the city of Constantinople. Before the reign of Theodosius II, synagogues were seen as private property and were protected by the imperial government. In Theodosius’s reign he enacted a law that forbade the construction of synagogues, and demanded the destruction of synagogues as well. Pulcheria and Theodosius also ordered that a group of Jews be killed after strife amongst Christians emerged in Palestine.[16] It was well known that Pulcheria had little respect for Jewish people, stemmed by her disapproval of Nestorian theological practices; Kenneth Holum writes “Pulcheria had long nursed a special hatred for Jews, and the Nestorian heresy, which appeared to contemporaries to be of Jewish origin; no doubt had served to confirm that hatred.”[17] Although Pulcheria was known to have strong feelings against pagans and Jews alike, she was known for her philanthropic spirit as well. She had built many churches in and around the city of Constantinople, she had also built many buildings for the poor in the city Sozomen writes that it would take too much time to describe all the churches Pulcheria built, as well as hospitals and inns for the poor.[18] Pulcherias building projects were so vast in Constantinople that a whole district was named in her honor called the Pulcherianai, Some of these establishments were extensive enough to give the names of their proprietors to entire quarters of the city such as the Marina quarter in the second region and the Pulcherianai in the eleventh.[19] As well as contributing to the city with new churches and districts, Pulcheria contributed significantly to the church by bringing back bishops or remains of bishops who had once been dismissed as relics to the church. Pope Leo I describes Pulcherias contributions to the church in a letter to her, ...the entire Roman Church is most grateful to you for all the works of your faith, whether having assisted envoys in every way with devoted affection and for having brought back the Catholic bishops who were ejected from their churches by an unjust sentence, or for having brought back with fitting honor to the church he governed so well the remains of Flavian of holy memory, an innocent and Catholic bishop.[20] Pulcherias time as Augusta was also marked with war and ongoing conflict with Persia. Pulcheria had inspired war against Persia when Persian King Yazdegerd I executed a Christian bishop who destroyed an Zoroastrian altar.[21] Under the influence of Pulcheria, Theodosius sent troops into battle against Persia, the fanaticism over the war by the people of the empire was described by Sozomen as ready to do anything for the sake of Christianity.[21] Pulcheria and Theodosius were victorious in their invasion of Persia, and according to historians Theodosius had credited his sisters vow of virginity as the reason for victory. Surviving letters identify the source of that victory through the vows of his sisters. In his view, when Pulcheria devoted her virginity to God and imposed the same vow on her sisters, she secured Gods favor, causing every threat and war raised against her brother to disperse spontaneously.[22] Theodosius had made his sisters virginity a tool of war propaganda, and because of her vow to be faithful only to God the hand of God would help Roman troops in battle against Persia. Pulcherias power would become even greater after the death of her brother Theodosius II.Aelia Pulcheria (January 19, 398 or 399 – 453) was the daughter of Eastern Roman Emperor Arcadius and Empress Aelia Eudoxia. She was the second child born to Arcadius and Eudoxia. Her older sister was Flaccilla, who was born in 397 but is assumed to have died young. Her younger siblings were Arcadia, born in 400, Theodosius II, the future emperor, and Marina, both born in 401.[1] When her father Arcadius died in 408, her brother Theodosius II was made Emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire, at seven years old. On July 4, 414 a fifteen-year-old Pulcheria proclaimed herself regent over her brother, then thirteen years of age, and made herself Augusta and Empress of the Eastern Roman Empire. According to the ancient historian Sozomen, in his Ecclesiastical History, Pulcheria took a vow of virginity when she became Augusta, and her sisters followed suit. Theodosius II died on July 26, 450, and Pulcheria soon married Marcian on November 25, 450. Marcian and Pulcheria were proclaimed Emperor and Empress of the Eastern Roman Empire. Three years later, in July 453, Pulcheria died; she was later made a saint by the Church.[2] Pulcheria is known to have held a significant amount of power in her brothers reign as emperor. Pulcheria was also of great influence over the church and theological practices of this time. She had influence over anti-pagan policies, church building projects, and the debate over the Marian title Theotokos (Birth-giver to God).Contents  [hide] 1 Biography1.1 Early life1.2 The Emperors Guardian1.3 Vow of virginity1.4 Augusta1.5 Empress1.5.1 Church conflict1.6 Death2 Relationship with Aelia Eudocia3 Influence over the church4 See also5 Notes6 ReferencesBiography[edit]Early life[edit]Pulcheria was born into the royal House of Theodosius, a dynasty of the later Roman empire, ruling in Constantinople. Her father was Arcadius, and her mother was Aelia Eudoxia. Like Pulcheria, her mother was also powerful and of great influence over the church, however not in the same way Pulcheria was. Arcadius reign was marked by the conflict between his wife and the Bishop of Constantinople,“Although his reign (Arcadius) was short, it is remembered in part for the controversial conflicts Eudoxia encountered with John Chrysostom, bishop of Constantinople from 398 to 404.[3] According to the ancient historian Sozomen, in his Ecclesiastical History, Sozomen claims that much of the rivalry was based on an ornate statue made in the honor of Eudoxia which Chrysostom condemned, “The silver statue of the empress...was placed upon a column of porphyry; and the event was celebrated by loud acclamations, dancing, games, and other manifestations of public rejoicing...John declared that these proceedings reflected dishonor on the church.”[4] According to Sozomen, John had also condemned the empress for her grandiose style of ruling over the empire and condemned her in the church, this of course enraged the empress and John was immediately disposed of. Later in life, Pulcheria would bring back the remains of John Chrysostom and make them into relics for the church, in gratitude for his pious life.[5] Eudoxia died in 404 and the emperor Arcadius died in 408. The emperor left behind four young children, including a seven-year-old Theodosius II. Theodosius was made emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire in 408, immediately after his father died.

Eventually Pulcheria herself would take over as regent for her brother.The Emperors Guardian[edit]Once Pulcheria came of age, at fifteen, she felt, like her brother, that her family had no need for Antiochus any longer; her brother dismissed him of his duties. She then became her own brother’s regent: “In 412 Pulcheria quarreled with Antiochus, who like Anthemius had served the dynasty faithfully for a number of years, and induced her brother to dismiss him from the duties of praepositus. She then took personal charge of the imperial family, directing its affairs with such authority that she became known in society at large as the emperor’s guardian.”[6] Immediately when Pulcheria took authority over the imperial palace, the palace took on a much more monastic tone compared to that of her mother’s palace. Sozomen describes Pulcheria’s and her sisters pious ways in his Ecclesiastical History: “They all pursue the same mode of life; they are sedulous in their attendance in the house of prayer, and evince great charity towards strangers and the poor...and pass their days and their nights together in singing the praises of God.”[7] Rituals within the imperial palace also included chanting and reciting passages in the scripture, and fasting twice a week.[6] The sisters were known to have given up luxurious jewelry and apparel worn by most women of the imperial court of the past. Pulcheria also took on the role of providing all the training necessary for Theodosius to become a successful emperor, once he came of age. Although the empire was technically to be ruled by Theodosius II when he would come of age, his older sister Pulcheria exercised such profound influence over him all his life that she must be considered the co-regent of the empire until her death in 453. In fact it can be said without exaggeration that Pulcheria gave the identity to her brothers reign.[8] Pulcherias training of Theodosius included, ...how an Emperor must walk, and ride his horse, alone or in procession; how he should sit upon his throne: how to wear his Imperial armor and robes; and how to speak with dignity. By no means must he yield to loud laughter...[9] Not only did Pulcheria train her brother on the duties and customs of becoming an Emperor, but she also made sure Theodosius was trained to be a pious Christian leader. Once Theodosius came of age to rule as sole Emperor, according to many historians, the teachings of his sister had been ignored. “He was by nature kind, affable, easily led...Not only was he foolishly kind; he was careless, and often he was to neglect his duty in the administration of his Empire.”[10] This lack of power that Theodosius exemplified led to Pulcheria taking on a much larger role of authority and influence in the Empire.Vow of virginity[edit]At the same time Pulcheria proclaimed herself as guardian over her brother she also took a vow of virginity, and her sisters did as well. Pulcheria’s reason for a vow of virginity may have been her deeply religious virtue as recorded by Sozomen: “She devoted her virginity to God, and instructed her sisters to do likewise. To avoid cause of scandal and opportunities for intrigue, she permitted no man to enter her palace. In confirmation of her resolution she took God, the priests, and all the subjects of the Roman empire as witnesses...”[11] Another contemporary of Pulcheria had also described her deep piety. In a letter from Pope Leo I to Pulcheria, he compliments her on her deeply religious ways: In it you clearly show how much you love the Catholic faith and how much you despise the errors of heretics.[12] Along with being deeply pious, it is possible that Pulcheria may have had other motives to take a vow of virginity. According to ancient historians Sozomen, Socrates, and Theodoret, Pulcheria had a deep dislike for Anthemius, the former guardian of Theodosius;[13] the reasons may have been his distaste for her immense power within the empire and her unwillingness to allow Anthemius to gain power amongst the imperial court. A more recent historian, Kenneth Holum, states that Anthemius had tried to make family ties between himself and the imperial family: “Married long since and many years Pulcheria’s senior, Anthemis naturally proposed a descendent or close relative, a grandson perhaps...born a few years earlier than Pulcheria and an excellent prospect for her hand”[14] Pulcheria had found herself in a position where she would have to give her power up to her potential husband, for once a woman in the imperial court married her power was to be relinquished to her husband. In order for Pulcheria to keep her power within the imperial court she took a vow of virginity to ensure that another man could not share her power.Augusta[edit]In 414 the Roman senate made Pulcheria Augusta. During her time as Augusta, Pulcheria held a great deal of power in politics and although she was a woman was treated equally among other men of power. In the senate of Constantinople lay a bust in her honor along with the other Augusti.[15] Many important events occurred during her time as Augusta and her brothers reign as emperor; however, Pulcheria’s influence was mostly in the church. Pulcheria and her brother were known to have harbored anti Jewish sentiment, and both had started to enact laws against Jewish worship in the city of Constantinople. Before the reign of Theodosius II, synagogues were seen as private property and were protected by the imperial government. In Theodosius’s reign he enacted a law that forbade the construction of synagogues, and demanded the destruction of synagogues as well. Pulcheria and Theodosius also ordered that a group of Jews be killed after strife amongst Christians emerged in Palestine.[16] It was well known that Pulcheria had little respect for Jewish people, stemmed by her disapproval of Nestorian theological practices; Kenneth Holum writes “Pulcheria had long nursed a special hatred for Jews, and the Nestorian heresy, which appeared to contemporaries to be of Jewish origin; no doubt had served to confirm that hatred.”[17] Although Pulcheria was known to have strong feelings against pagans and Jews alike, she was known for her philanthropic spirit as well. She had built many churches in and around the city of Constantinople, she had also built many buildings for the poor in the city Sozomen writes that it would take too much time to describe all the churches Pulcheria built, as well as hospitals and inns for the poor.[18] Pulcherias building projects were so vast in Constantinople that a whole district was named in her honor called the Pulcherianai, Some of these establishments were extensive enough to give the names of their proprietors to entire quarters of the city such as the Marina quarter in the second region and the Pulcherianai in the eleventh.[19] As well as contributing to the city with new churches and districts, Pulcheria contributed significantly to the church by bringing back bishops or remains of bishops who had once been dismissed as relics to the church. Pope Leo I describes Pulcherias contributions to the church in a letter to her, ...the entire Roman Church is most grateful to you for all the works of your faith, whether having assisted envoys in every way with devoted affection and for having brought back the Catholic bishops who were ejected from their churches by an unjust sentence, or for having brought back with fitting honor to the church he governed so well the remains of Flavian of holy memory, an innocent and Catholic bishop.[20] Pulcherias time as Augusta was also marked with war and ongoing conflict with Persia. Pulcheria had inspired war against Persia when Persian King Yazdegerd I executed a Christian bishop who destroyed an Zoroastrian altar.[21] Under the influence of Pulcheria, Theodosius sent troops into battle against Persia, the fanaticism over the war by the people of the empire was described by Sozomen as ready to do anything for the sake of Christianity.[21] Pulcheria and Theodosius were victorious in their invasion of Persia, and according to historians Theodosius had credited his sisters vow of virginity as the reason for victory. Surviving letters identify the source of that victory through the vows of his sisters. In his view, when Pulcheria devoted her virginity to God and imposed the same vow on her sisters, she secured Gods favor, causing every threat and war raised against her brother to disperse spontaneously.[22] Theodosius had made his sisters virginity a tool of war propaganda, and because of her vow to be faithful only to God the hand of God would help Roman troops in battle against Persia. Pulcherias power would become even greater after the death of her brother Theodosius II.Aelia Pulcheria (January 19, 398 or 399 – 453) was the daughter of Eastern Roman Emperor Arcadius and Empress Aelia Eudoxia. She was the second child born to Arcadius and Eudoxia. Her older sister was Flaccilla, who was born in 397 but is assumed to have died young. Her younger siblings were Arcadia, born in 400, Theodosius II, the future emperor, and Marina, both born in 401.[1] When her father Arcadius died in 408, her brother Theodosius II was made Emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire, at seven years old. On July 4, 414 a fifteen-year-old Pulcheria proclaimed herself regent over her brother, then thirteen years of age, and made herself Augusta and Empress of the Eastern Roman Empire. According to the ancient historian Sozomen, in his Ecclesiastical History, Pulcheria took a vow of virginity when she became Augusta, and her sisters followed suit. Theodosius II died on July 26, 450, and Pulcheria soon married Marcian on November 25, 450. Marcian and Pulcheria were proclaimed Emperor and Empress of the Eastern Roman Empire. Three years later, in July 453, Pulcheria died; she was later made a saint by the Church.[2] Pulcheria is known to have held a significant amount of power in her brothers reign as emperor. Pulcheria was also of great influence over the church and theological practices of this time. She had influence over anti-pagan policies, church building projects, and the debate over the Marian title Theotokos (Birth-giver to God).Contents  [hide] 1 Biography1.1 Early life1.2 The Emperors Guardian1.3 Vow of virginity1.4 Augusta1.5 Empress1.5.1 Church conflict1.6 Death2 Relationship with Aelia Eudocia3 Influence over the church4 See also5 Notes6 ReferencesBiography[edit]Early life[edit]Pulcheria was born into the royal House of Theodosius, a dynasty of the later Roman empire, ruling in Constantinople. Her father was Arcadius, and her mother was Aelia Eudoxia. Like Pulcheria, her mother was also powerful and of great influence over the church, however not in the same way Pulcheria was. Arcadius reign was marked by the conflict between his wife and the Bishop of Constantinople,“Although his reign (Arcadius) was short, it is remembered in part for the controversial conflicts Eudoxia encountered with John Chrysostom, bishop of Constantinople from 398 to 404.[3] According to the ancient historian Sozomen, in his Ecclesiastical History, Sozomen claims that much of the rivalry was based on an ornate statue made in the honor of Eudoxia which Chrysostom condemned, “The silver statue of the empress...was placed upon a column of porphyry; and the event was celebrated by loud acclamations, dancing, games, and other manifestations of public rejoicing...John declared that these proceedings reflected dishonor on the church.”[4] According to Sozomen, John had also condemned the empress for her grandiose style of ruling over the empire and condemned her in the church, this of course enraged the empress and John was immediately disposed of. Later in life, Pulcheria would bring back the remains of John Chrysostom and make them into relics for the church, in gratitude for his pious life.[5] Eudoxia died in 404 and the emperor Arcadius died in 408. The emperor left behind four young children, including a seven-year-old Theodosius II. Theodosius was made emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire in 408, immediately after his father died.

Two praetorian prefects were selected as regents over Theodosius, one being Anthemius and the other, Antiochus; both took over as regent. Eventually Pulcheria herself would take over as regent for her brother.The Emperors Guardian[edit]Once Pulcheria came of age, at fifteen, she felt, like her brother, that her family had no need for Antiochus any longer; her brother dismissed him of his duties. She then became her own brother’s regent: “In 412 Pulcheria quarreled with Antiochus, who like Anthemius had served the dynasty faithfully for a number of years, and induced her brother to dismiss him from the duties of praepositus. She then took personal charge of the imperial family, directing its affairs with such authority that she became known in society at large as the emperor’s guardian.”[6] Immediately when Pulcheria took authority over the imperial palace, the palace took on a much more monastic tone compared to that of her mother’s palace. Sozomen describes Pulcheria’s and her sisters pious ways in his Ecclesiastical History: “They all pursue the same mode of life; they are sedulous in their attendance in the house of prayer, and evince great charity towards strangers and the poor...and pass their days and their nights together in singing the praises of God.”[7] Rituals within the imperial palace also included chanting and reciting passages in the scripture, and fasting twice a week.[6] The sisters were known to have given up luxurious jewelry and apparel worn by most women of the imperial court of the past. Pulcheria also took on the role of providing all the training necessary for Theodosius to become a successful emperor, once he came of age. Although the empire was technically to be ruled by Theodosius II when he would come of age, his older sister Pulcheria exercised such profound influence over him all his life that she must be considered the co-regent of the empire until her death in 453. In fact it can be said without exaggeration that Pulcheria gave the identity to her brothers reign.[8] Pulcherias training of Theodosius included, ...how an Emperor must walk, and ride his horse, alone or in procession; how he should sit upon his throne: how to wear his Imperial armor and robes; and how to speak with dignity. By no means must he yield to loud laughter...[9] Not only did Pulcheria train her brother on the duties and customs of becoming an Emperor, but she also made sure Theodosius was trained to be a pious Christian leader. Once Theodosius came of age to rule as sole Emperor, according to many historians, the teachings of his sister had been ignored. “He was by nature kind, affable, easily led...Not only was he foolishly kind; he was careless, and often he was to neglect his duty in the administration of his Empire.”[10] This lack of power that Theodosius exemplified led to Pulcheria taking on a much larger role of authority and influence in the Empire.Vow of virginity[edit]At the same time Pulcheria proclaimed herself as guardian over her brother she also took a vow of virginity, and her sisters did as well. Pulcheria’s reason for a vow of virginity may have been her deeply religious virtue as recorded by Sozomen: “She devoted her virginity to God, and instructed her sisters to do likewise. To avoid cause of scandal and opportunities for intrigue, she permitted no man to enter her palace. In confirmation of her resolution she took God, the priests, and all the subjects of the Roman empire as witnesses...”[11] Another contemporary of Pulcheria had also described her deep piety. In a letter from Pope Leo I to Pulcheria, he compliments her on her deeply religious ways: In it you clearly show how much you love the Catholic faith and how much you despise the errors of heretics.[12] Along with being deeply pious, it is possible that Pulcheria may have had other motives to take a vow of virginity. According to ancient historians Sozomen, Socrates, and Theodoret, Pulcheria had a deep dislike for Anthemius, the former guardian of Theodosius;[13] the reasons may have been his distaste for her immense power within the empire and her unwillingness to allow Anthemius to gain power amongst the imperial court. A more recent historian, Kenneth Holum, states that Anthemius had tried to make family ties between himself and the imperial family: “Married long since and many years Pulcheria’s senior, Anthemis naturally proposed a descendent or close relative, a grandson perhaps...born a few years earlier than Pulcheria and an excellent prospect for her hand”[14] Pulcheria had found herself in a position where she would have to give her power up to her potential husband, for once a woman in the imperial court married her power was to be relinquished to her husband. In order for Pulcheria to keep her power within the imperial court she took a vow of virginity to ensure that another man could not share her power.Augusta[edit]In 414 the Roman senate made Pulcheria Augusta. During her time as Augusta, Pulcheria held a great deal of power in politics and although she was a woman was treated equally among other men of power. In the senate of Constantinople lay a bust in her honor along with the other Augusti.[15] Many important events occurred during her time as Augusta and her brothers reign as emperor; however, Pulcheria’s influence was mostly in the church. Pulcheria and her brother were known to have harbored anti Jewish sentiment, and both had started to enact laws against Jewish worship in the city of Constantinople. Before the reign of Theodosius II, synagogues were seen as private property and were protected by the imperial government. In Theodosius’s reign he enacted a law that forbade the construction of synagogues, and demanded the destruction of synagogues as well. Pulcheria and Theodosius also ordered that a group of Jews be killed after strife amongst Christians emerged in Palestine.[16] It was well known that Pulcheria had little respect for Jewish people, stemmed by her disapproval of Nestorian theological practices; Kenneth Holum writes “Pulcheria had long nursed a special hatred for Jews, and the Nestorian heresy, which appeared to contemporaries to be of Jewish origin; no doubt had served to confirm that hatred.”[17] Although Pulcheria was known to have strong feelings against pagans and Jews alike, she was known for her philanthropic spirit as well. She had built many churches in and around the city of Constantinople, she had also built many buildings for the poor in the city Sozomen writes that it would take too much time to describe all the churches Pulcheria built, as well as hospitals and inns for the poor.[18] Pulcherias building projects were so vast in Constantinople that a whole district was named in her honor called the Pulcherianai, Some of these establishments were extensive enough to give the names of their proprietors to entire quarters of the city such as the Marina quarter in the second region and the Pulcherianai in the eleventh.[19] As well as contributing to the city with new churches and districts, Pulcheria contributed significantly to the church by bringing back bishops or remains of bishops who had once been dismissed as relics to the church. Pope Leo I describes Pulcherias contributions to the church in a letter to her, ...the entire Roman Church is most grateful to you for all the works of your faith, whether having assisted envoys in every way with devoted affection and for having brought back the Catholic bishops who were ejected from their churches by an unjust sentence, or for having brought back with fitting honor to the church he governed so well the remains of Flavian of holy memory, an innocent and Catholic bishop.[20] Pulcherias time as Augusta was also marked with war and ongoing conflict with Persia. Pulcheria had inspired war against Persia when Persian King Yazdegerd I executed a Christian bishop who destroyed an Zoroastrian altar.[21] Under the influence of Pulcheria, Theodosius sent troops into battle against Persia, the fanaticism over the war by the people of the empire was described by Sozomen as ready to do anything for the sake of Christianity.[21] Pulcheria and Theodosius were victorious in their invasion of Persia, and according to historians Theodosius had credited his sisters vow of virginity as the reason for victory. Surviving letters identify the source of that victory through the vows of his sisters. In his view, when Pulcheria devoted her virginity to God and imposed the same vow on her sisters, she secured Gods favor, causing every threat and war raised against her brother to disperse spontaneously.[22] Theodosius had made his sisters virginity a tool of war propaganda, and because of her vow to be faithful only to God the hand of God would help Roman troops in battle against Persia. Pulcherias power would become even greater after the death of her brother Theodosius II.Aelia Pulcheria (January 19, 398 or 399 – 453) was the daughter of Eastern Roman Emperor Arcadius and Empress Aelia Eudoxia. She was the second child born to Arcadius and Eudoxia. Her older sister was Flaccilla, who was born in 397 but is assumed to have died young. Her younger siblings were Arcadia, born in 400, Theodosius II, the future emperor, and Marina, both born in 401.[1] When her father Arcadius died in 408, her brother Theodosius II was made Emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire, at seven years old. On July 4, 414 a fifteen-year-old Pulcheria proclaimed herself regent over her brother, then thirteen years of age, and made herself Augusta and Empress of the Eastern Roman Empire. According to the ancient historian Sozomen, in his Ecclesiastical History, Pulcheria took a vow of virginity when she became Augusta, and her sisters followed suit. Theodosius II died on July 26, 450, and Pulcheria soon married Marcian on November 25, 450. Marcian and Pulcheria were proclaimed Emperor and Empress of the Eastern Roman Empire. Three years later, in July 453, Pulcheria died; she was later made a saint by the Church.[2] Pulcheria is known to have held a significant amount of power in her brothers reign as emperor. Pulcheria was also of great influence over the church and theological practices of this time. She had influence over anti-pagan policies, church building projects, and the debate over the Marian title Theotokos (Birth-giver to God).Contents  [hide] 1 Biography1.1 Early life1.2 The Emperors Guardian1.3 Vow of virginity1.4 Augusta1.5 Empress1.5.1 Church conflict1.6 Death2 Relationship with Aelia Eudocia3 Influence over the church4 See also5 Notes6 ReferencesBiography[edit]Early life[edit]Pulcheria was born into the royal House of Theodosius, a dynasty of the later Roman empire, ruling in Constantinople. Her father was Arcadius, and her mother was Aelia Eudoxia. Like Pulcheria, her mother was also powerful and of great influence over the church, however not in the same way Pulcheria was. Arcadius reign was marked by the conflict between his wife and the Bishop of Constantinople,“Although his reign (Arcadius) was short, it is remembered in part for the controversial conflicts Eudoxia encountered with John Chrysostom, bishop of Constantinople from 398 to 404.[3] According to the ancient historian Sozomen, in his Ecclesiastical History, Sozomen claims that much of the rivalry was based on an ornate statue made in the honor of Eudoxia which Chrysostom condemned, “The silver statue of the empress...was placed upon a column of porphyry; and the event was celebrated by loud acclamations, dancing, games, and other manifestations of public rejoicing...John declared that these proceedings reflected dishonor on the church.”[4] According to Sozomen, John had also condemned the empress for her grandiose style of ruling over the empire and condemned her in the church, this of course enraged the empress and John was immediately disposed of. Later in life, Pulcheria would bring back the remains of John Chrysostom and make them into relics for the church, in gratitude for his pious life.[5] Eudoxia died in 404 and the emperor Arcadius died in 408.

Later in life, Pulcheria would bring back the remains of John Chrysostom and make them into relics for the church, in gratitude for his pious life.[5] Eudoxia died in 404 and the emperor Arcadius died in 408. The emperor left behind four young children, including a seven-year-old Theodosius II. Theodosius was made emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire in 408, immediately after his father died. Two praetorian prefects were selected as regents over Theodosius, one being Anthemius and the other, Antiochus; both took over as regent. Eventually Pulcheria herself would take over as regent for her brother.The Emperors Guardian[edit]Once Pulcheria came of age, at fifteen, she felt, like her brother, that her family had no need for Antiochus any longer; her brother dismissed him of his duties. She then became her own brother’s regent: “In 412 Pulcheria quarreled with Antiochus, who like Anthemius had served the dynasty faithfully for a number of years, and induced her brother to dismiss him from the duties of praepositus. She then took personal charge of the imperial family, directing its affairs with such authority that she became known in society at large as the emperor’s guardian.”[6] Immediately when Pulcheria took authority over the imperial palace, the palace took on a much more monastic tone compared to that of her mother’s palace. Sozomen describes Pulcheria’s and her sisters pious ways in his Ecclesiastical History: “They all pursue the same mode of life; they are sedulous in their attendance in the house of prayer, and evince great charity towards strangers and the poor...and pass their days and their nights together in singing the praises of God.”[7] Rituals within the imperial palace also included chanting and reciting passages in the scripture, and fasting twice a week.[6] The sisters were known to have given up luxurious jewelry and apparel worn by most women of the imperial court of the past. Pulcheria also took on the role of providing all the training necessary for Theodosius to become a successful emperor, once he came of age. Although the empire was technically to be ruled by Theodosius II when he would come of age, his older sister Pulcheria exercised such profound influence over him all his life that she must be considered the co-regent of the empire until her death in 453. In fact it can be said without exaggeration that Pulcheria gave the identity to her brothers reign.[8] Pulcherias training of Theodosius included, ...how an Emperor must walk, and ride his horse, alone or in procession; how he should sit upon his throne: how to wear his Imperial armor and robes; and how to speak with dignity. By no means must he yield to loud laughter...[9] Not only did Pulcheria train her brother on the duties and customs of becoming an Emperor, but she also made sure Theodosius was trained to be a pious Christian leader. Once Theodosius came of age to rule as sole Emperor, according to many historians, the teachings of his sister had been ignored. “He was by nature kind, affable, easily led...Not only was he foolishly kind; he was careless, and often he was to neglect his duty in the administration of his Empire.”[10] This lack of power that Theodosius exemplified led to Pulcheria taking on a much larger role of authority and influence in the Empire.Vow of virginity[edit]At the same time Pulcheria proclaimed herself as guardian over her brother she also took a vow of virginity, and her sisters did as well. Pulcheria’s reason for a vow of virginity may have been her deeply religious virtue as recorded by Sozomen: “She devoted her virginity to God, and instructed her sisters to do likewise. To avoid cause of scandal and opportunities for intrigue, she permitted no man to enter her palace. In confirmation of her resolution she took God, the priests, and all the subjects of the Roman empire as witnesses...”[11] Another contemporary of Pulcheria had also described her deep piety. In a letter from Pope Leo I to Pulcheria, he compliments her on her deeply religious ways: In it you clearly show how much you love the Catholic faith and how much you despise the errors of heretics.[12] Along with being deeply pious, it is possible that Pulcheria may have had other motives to take a vow of virginity. According to ancient historians Sozomen, Socrates, and Theodoret, Pulcheria had a deep dislike for Anthemius, the former guardian of Theodosius;[13] the reasons may have been his distaste for her immense power within the empire and her unwillingness to allow Anthemius to gain power amongst the imperial court. A more recent historian, Kenneth Holum, states that Anthemius had tried to make family ties between himself and the imperial family: “Married long since and many years Pulcheria’s senior, Anthemis naturally proposed a descendent or close relative, a grandson perhaps...born a few years earlier than Pulcheria and an excellent prospect for her hand”[14] Pulcheria had found herself in a position where she would have to give her power up to her potential husband, for once a woman in the imperial court married her power was to be relinquished to her husband. In order for Pulcheria to keep her power within the imperial court she took a vow of virginity to ensure that another man could not share her power.Augusta[edit]In 414 the Roman senate made Pulcheria Augusta. During her time as Augusta, Pulcheria held a great deal of power in politics and although she was a woman was treated equally among other men of power. In the senate of Constantinople lay a bust in her honor along with the other Augusti.[15] Many important events occurred during her time as Augusta and her brothers reign as emperor; however, Pulcheria’s influence was mostly in the church. Pulcheria and her brother were known to have harbored anti Jewish sentiment, and both had started to enact laws against Jewish worship in the city of Constantinople. Before the reign of Theodosius II, synagogues were seen as private property and were protected by the imperial government. In Theodosius’s reign he enacted a law that forbade the construction of synagogues, and demanded the destruction of synagogues as well. Pulcheria and Theodosius also ordered that a group of Jews be killed after strife amongst Christians emerged in Palestine.[16] It was well known that Pulcheria had little respect for Jewish people, stemmed by her disapproval of Nestorian theological practices; Kenneth Holum writes “Pulcheria had long nursed a special hatred for Jews, and the Nestorian heresy, which appeared to contemporaries to be of Jewish origin; no doubt had served to confirm that hatred.”[17] Although Pulcheria was known to have strong feelings against pagans and Jews alike, she was known for her philanthropic spirit as well. She had built many churches in and around the city of Constantinople, she had also built many buildings for the poor in the city Sozomen writes that it would take too much time to describe all the churches Pulcheria built, as well as hospitals and inns for the poor.[18] Pulcherias building projects were so vast in Constantinople that a whole district was named in her honor called the Pulcherianai, Some of these establishments were extensive enough to give the names of their proprietors to entire quarters of the city such as the Marina quarter in the second region and the Pulcherianai in the eleventh.[19] As well as contributing to the city with new churches and districts, Pulcheria contributed significantly to the church by bringing back bishops or remains of bishops who had once been dismissed as relics to the church. Pope Leo I describes Pulcherias contributions to the church in a letter to her, ...the entire Roman Church is most grateful to you for all the works of your faith, whether having assisted envoys in every way with devoted affection and for having brought back the Catholic bishops who were ejected from their churches by an unjust sentence, or for having brought back with fitting honor to the church he governed so well the remains of Flavian of holy memory, an innocent and Catholic bishop.[20] Pulcherias time as Augusta was also marked with war and ongoing conflict with Persia. Pulcheria had inspired war against Persia when Persian King Yazdegerd I executed a Christian bishop who destroyed an Zoroastrian altar.[21] Under the influence of Pulcheria, Theodosius sent troops into battle against Persia, the fanaticism over the war by the people of the empire was described by Sozomen as ready to do anything for the sake of Christianity.[21] Pulcheria and Theodosius were victorious in their invasion of Persia, and according to historians Theodosius had credited his sisters vow of virginity as the reason for victory. Surviving letters identify the source of that victory through the vows of his sisters. In his view, when Pulcheria devoted her virginity to God and imposed the same vow on her sisters, she secured Gods favor, causing every threat and war raised against her brother to disperse spontaneously.[22] Theodosius had made his sisters virginity a tool of war propaganda, and because of her vow to be faithful only to God the hand of God would help Roman troops in battle against Persia. Pulcherias power would become even greater after the death of her brother Theodosius II.Aelia Pulcheria (January 19, 398 or 399 – 453) was the daughter of Eastern Roman Emperor Arcadius and Empress Aelia Eudoxia. She was the second child born to Arcadius and Eudoxia. Her older sister was Flaccilla, who was born in 397 but is assumed to have died young. Her younger siblings were Arcadia, born in 400, Theodosius II, the future emperor, and Marina, both born in 401.[1] When her father Arcadius died in 408, her brother Theodosius II was made Emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire, at seven years old. On July 4, 414 a fifteen-year-old Pulcheria proclaimed herself regent over her brother, then thirteen years of age, and made herself Augusta and Empress of the Eastern Roman Empire. According to the ancient historian Sozomen, in his Ecclesiastical History, Pulcheria took a vow of virginity when she became Augusta, and her sisters followed suit. Theodosius II died on July 26, 450, and Pulcheria soon married Marcian on November 25, 450. Marcian and Pulcheria were proclaimed Emperor and Empress of the Eastern Roman Empire. Three years later, in July 453, Pulcheria died; she was later made a saint by the Church.[2] Pulcheria is known to have held a significant amount of power in her brothers reign as emperor. Pulcheria was also of great influence over the church and theological practices of this time. She had influence over anti-pagan policies, church building projects, and the debate over the Marian title Theotokos (Birth-giver to God).Contents  [hide] 1 Biography1.1 Early life1.2 The Emperors Guardian1.3 Vow of virginity1.4 Augusta1.5 Empress1.5.1 Church conflict1.6 Death2 Relationship with Aelia Eudocia3 Influence over the church4 See also5 Notes6 ReferencesBiography[edit]Early life[edit]Pulcheria was born into the royal House of Theodosius, a dynasty of the later Roman empire, ruling in Constantinople.

Arcadius reign was marked by the conflict between his wife and the Bishop of Constantinople,“Although his reign (Arcadius) was short, it is remembered in part for the controversial conflicts Eudoxia encountered with John Chrysostom, bishop of Constantinople from 398 to 404.[3] According to the ancient historian Sozomen, in his Ecclesiastical History, Sozomen claims that much of the rivalry was based on an ornate statue made in the honor of Eudoxia which Chrysostom condemned, “The silver statue of the empress...was placed upon a column of porphyry; and the event was celebrated by loud acclamations, dancing, games, and other manifestations of public rejoicing...John declared that these proceedings reflected dishonor on the church.”[4] According to Sozomen, John had also condemned the empress for her grandiose style of ruling over the empire and condemned her in the church, this of course enraged the empress and John was immediately disposed of. Later in life, Pulcheria would bring back the remains of John Chrysostom and make them into relics for the church, in gratitude for his pious life.[5] Eudoxia died in 404 and the emperor Arcadius died in 408. The emperor left behind four young children, including a seven-year-old Theodosius II. Theodosius was made emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire in 408, immediately after his father died. Two praetorian prefects were selected as regents over Theodosius, one being Anthemius and the other, Antiochus; both took over as regent. Eventually Pulcheria herself would take over as regent for her brother.The Emperors Guardian[edit]Once Pulcheria came of age, at fifteen, she felt, like her brother, that her family had no need for Antiochus any longer; her brother dismissed him of his duties. She then became her own brother’s regent: “In 412 Pulcheria quarreled with Antiochus, who like Anthemius had served the dynasty faithfully for a number of years, and induced her brother to dismiss him from the duties of praepositus. She then took personal charge of the imperial family, directing its affairs with such authority that she became known in society at large as the emperor’s guardian.”[6] Immediately when Pulcheria took authority over the imperial palace, the palace took on a much more monastic tone compared to that of her mother’s palace. Sozomen describes Pulcheria’s and her sisters pious ways in his Ecclesiastical History: “They all pursue the same mode of life; they are sedulous in their attendance in the house of prayer, and evince great charity towards strangers and the poor...and pass their days and their nights together in singing the praises of God.”[7] Rituals within the imperial palace also included chanting and reciting passages in the scripture, and fasting twice a week.[6] The sisters were known to have given up luxurious jewelry and apparel worn by most women of the imperial court of the past. Pulcheria also took on the role of providing all the training necessary for Theodosius to become a successful emperor, once he came of age. Although the empire was technically to be ruled by Theodosius II when he would come of age, his older sister Pulcheria exercised such profound influence over him all his life that she must be considered the co-regent of the empire until her death in 453. In fact it can be said without exaggeration that Pulcheria gave the identity to her brothers reign.[8] Pulcherias training of Theodosius included, ...how an Emperor must walk, and ride his horse, alone or in procession; how he should sit upon his throne: how to wear his Imperial armor and robes; and how to speak with dignity. By no means must he yield to loud laughter...[9] Not only did Pulcheria train her brother on the duties and customs of becoming an Emperor, but she also made sure Theodosius was trained to be a pious Christian leader. Once Theodosius came of age to rule as sole Emperor, according to many historians, the teachings of his sister had been ignored. “He was by nature kind, affable, easily led...Not only was he foolishly kind; he was careless, and often he was to neglect his duty in the administration of his Empire.”[10] This lack of power that Theodosius exemplified led to Pulcheria taking on a much larger role of authority and influence in the Empire.Vow of virginity[edit]At the same time Pulcheria proclaimed herself as guardian over her brother she also took a vow of virginity, and her sisters did as well. Pulcheria’s reason for a vow of virginity may have been her deeply religious virtue as recorded by Sozomen: “She devoted her virginity to God, and instructed her sisters to do likewise. To avoid cause of scandal and opportunities for intrigue, she permitted no man to enter her palace. In confirmation of her resolution she took God, the priests, and all the subjects of the Roman empire as witnesses...”[11] Another contemporary of Pulcheria had also described her deep piety. In a letter from Pope Leo I to Pulcheria, he compliments her on her deeply religious ways: In it you clearly show how much you love the Catholic faith and how much you despise the errors of heretics.[12] Along with being deeply pious, it is possible that Pulcheria may have had other motives to take a vow of virginity. According to ancient historians Sozomen, Socrates, and Theodoret, Pulcheria had a deep dislike for Anthemius, the former guardian of Theodosius;[13] the reasons may have been his distaste for her immense power within the empire and her unwillingness to allow Anthemius to gain power amongst the imperial court. A more recent historian, Kenneth Holum, states that Anthemius had tried to make family ties between himself and the imperial family: “Married long since and many years Pulcheria’s senior, Anthemis naturally proposed a descendent or close relative, a grandson perhaps...born a few years earlier than Pulcheria and an excellent prospect for her hand”[14] Pulcheria had found herself in a position where she would have to give her power up to her potential husband, for once a woman in the imperial court married her power was to be relinquished to her husband. In order for Pulcheria to keep her power within the imperial court she took a vow of virginity to ensure that another man could not share her power.Augusta[edit]In 414 the Roman senate made Pulcheria Augusta. During her time as Augusta, Pulcheria held a great deal of power in politics and although she was a woman was treated equally among other men of power. In the senate of Constantinople lay a bust in her honor along with the other Augusti.[15] Many important events occurred during her time as Augusta and her brothers reign as emperor; however, Pulcheria’s influence was mostly in the church. Pulcheria and her brother were known to have harbored anti Jewish sentiment, and both had started to enact laws against Jewish worship in the city of Constantinople. Before the reign of Theodosius II, synagogues were seen as private property and were protected by the imperial government. In Theodosius’s reign he enacted a law that forbade the construction of synagogues, and demanded the destruction of synagogues as well. Pulcheria and Theodosius also ordered that a group of Jews be killed after strife amongst Christians emerged in Palestine.[16] It was well known that Pulcheria had little respect for Jewish people, stemmed by her disapproval of Nestorian theological practices; Kenneth Holum writes “Pulcheria had long nursed a special hatred for Jews, and the Nestorian heresy, which appeared to contemporaries to be of Jewish origin; no doubt had served to confirm that hatred.”[17] Although Pulcheria was known to have strong feelings against pagans and Jews alike, she was known for her philanthropic spirit as well. She had built many churches in and around the city of Constantinople, she had also built many buildings for the poor in the city Sozomen writes that it would take too much time to describe all the churches Pulcheria built, as well as hospitals and inns for the poor.[18] Pulcherias building projects were so vast in Constantinople that a whole district was named in her honor called the Pulcherianai, Some of these establishments were extensive enough to give the names of their proprietors to entire quarters of the city such as the Marina quarter in the second region and the Pulcherianai in the eleventh.[19] As well as contributing to the city with new churches and districts, Pulcheria contributed significantly to the church by bringing back bishops or remains of bishops who had once been dismissed as relics to the church. Pope Leo I describes Pulcherias contributions to the church in a letter to her, ...the entire Roman Church is most grateful to you for all the works of your faith, whether having assisted envoys in every way with devoted affection and for having brought back the Catholic bishops who were ejected from their churches by an unjust sentence, or for having brought back with fitting honor to the church he governed so well the remains of Flavian of holy memory, an innocent and Catholic bishop.[20] Pulcherias time as Augusta was also marked with war and ongoing conflict with Persia. Pulcheria had inspired war against Persia when Persian King Yazdegerd I executed a Christian bishop who destroyed an Zoroastrian altar.[21] Under the influence of Pulcheria, Theodosius sent troops into battle against Persia, the fanaticism over the war by the people of the empire was described by Sozomen as ready to do anything for the sake of Christianity.[21] Pulcheria and Theodosius were victorious in their invasion of Persia, and according to historians Theodosius had credited his sisters vow of virginity as the reason for victory. Surviving letters identify the source of that victory through the vows of his sisters. In his view, when Pulcheria devoted her virginity to God and imposed the same vow on her sisters, she secured Gods favor, causing every threat and war raised against her brother to disperse spontaneously.[22] Theodosius had made his sisters virginity a tool of war propaganda, and because of her vow to be faithful only to God the hand of God would help Roman troops in battle against Persia. Pulcherias power would become even greater after the death of her brother Theodosius II.Aelia Pulcheria (January 19, 398 or 399 – 453) was the daughter of Eastern Roman Emperor Arcadius and Empress Aelia Eudoxia. She was the second child born to Arcadius and Eudoxia. Her older sister was Flaccilla, who was born in 397 but is assumed to have died young. Her younger siblings were Arcadia, born in 400, Theodosius II, the future emperor, and Marina, both born in 401.[1] When her father Arcadius died in 408, her brother Theodosius II was made Emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire, at seven years old. On July 4, 414 a fifteen-year-old Pulcheria proclaimed herself regent over her brother, then thirteen years of age, and made herself Augusta and Empress of the Eastern Roman Empire. According to the ancient historian Sozomen, in his Ecclesiastical History, Pulcheria took a vow of virginity when she became Augusta, and her sisters followed suit. Theodosius II died on July 26, 450, and Pulcheria soon married Marcian on November 25, 450. Marcian and Pulcheria were proclaimed Emperor and Empress of the Eastern Roman Empire. Three years later, in July 453, Pulcheria died; she was later made a saint by the Church.[2] Pulcheria is known to have held a significant amount of power in her brothers reign as emperor. Pulcheria was also of great influence over the church and theological practices of this time.

She had influence over anti-pagan policies, church building projects, and the debate over the Marian title Theotokos (Birth-giver to God).Contents  [hide] 1 Biography1.1 Early life1.2 The Emperors Guardian1.3 Vow of virginity1.4 Augusta1.5 Empress1.5.1 Church conflict1.6 Death2 Relationship with Aelia Eudocia3 Influence over the church4 See also5 Notes6 ReferencesBiography[edit]Early life[edit]Pulcheria was born into the royal House of Theodosius, a dynasty of the later Roman empire, ruling in Constantinople. Her father was Arcadius, and her mother was Aelia Eudoxia. Like Pulcheria, her mother was also powerful and of great influence over the church, however not in the same way Pulcheria was. Arcadius reign was marked by the conflict between his wife and the Bishop of Constantinople,“Although his reign (Arcadius) was short, it is remembered in part for the controversial conflicts Eudoxia encountered with John Chrysostom, bishop of Constantinople from 398 to 404.[3] According to the ancient historian Sozomen, in his Ecclesiastical History, Sozomen claims that much of the rivalry was based on an ornate statue made in the honor of Eudoxia which Chrysostom condemned, “The silver statue of the empress...was placed upon a column of porphyry; and the event was celebrated by loud acclamations, dancing, games, and other manifestations of public rejoicing...John declared that these proceedings reflected dishonor on the church.”[4] According to Sozomen, John had also condemned the empress for her grandiose style of ruling over the empire and condemned her in the church, this of course enraged the empress and John was immediately disposed of. Later in life, Pulcheria would bring back the remains of John Chrysostom and make them into relics for the church, in gratitude for his pious life.[5] Eudoxia died in 404 and the emperor Arcadius died in 408. The emperor left behind four young children, including a seven-year-old Theodosius II. Theodosius was made emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire in 408, immediately after his father died. Two praetorian prefects were selected as regents over Theodosius, one being Anthemius and the other, Antiochus; both took over as regent. Eventually Pulcheria herself would take over as regent for her brother.The Emperors Guardian[edit]Once Pulcheria came of age, at fifteen, she felt, like her brother, that her family had no need for Antiochus any longer; her brother dismissed him of his duties. She then became her own brother’s regent: “In 412 Pulcheria quarreled with Antiochus, who like Anthemius had served the dynasty faithfully for a number of years, and induced her brother to dismiss him from the duties of praepositus. She then took personal charge of the imperial family, directing its affairs with such authority that she became known in society at large as the emperor’s guardian.”[6] Immediately when Pulcheria took authority over the imperial palace, the palace took on a much more monastic tone compared to that of her mother’s palace. Sozomen describes Pulcheria’s and her sisters pious ways in his Ecclesiastical History: “They all pursue the same mode of life; they are sedulous in their attendance in the house of prayer, and evince great charity towards strangers and the poor...and pass their days and their nights together in singing the praises of God.”[7] Rituals within the imperial palace also included chanting and reciting passages in the scripture, and fasting twice a week.[6] The sisters were known to have given up luxurious jewelry and apparel worn by most women of the imperial court of the past. Pulcheria also took on the role of providing all the training necessary for Theodosius to become a successful emperor, once he came of age. Although the empire was technically to be ruled by Theodosius II when he would come of age, his older sister Pulcheria exercised such profound influence over him all his life that she must be considered the co-regent of the empire until her death in 453. In fact it can be said without exaggeration that Pulcheria gave the identity to her brothers reign.[8] Pulcherias training of Theodosius included, ...how an Emperor must walk, and ride his horse, alone or in procession; how he should sit upon his throne: how to wear his Imperial armor and robes; and how to speak with dignity. By no means must he yield to loud laughter...[9] Not only did Pulcheria train her brother on the duties and customs of becoming an Emperor, but she also made sure Theodosius was trained to be a pious Christian leader. Once Theodosius came of age to rule as sole Emperor, according to many historians, the teachings of his sister had been ignored. “He was by nature kind, affable, easily led...Not only was he foolishly kind; he was careless, and often he was to neglect his duty in the administration of his Empire.”[10] This lack of power that Theodosius exemplified led to Pulcheria taking on a much larger role of authority and influence in the Empire.Vow of virginity[edit]At the same time Pulcheria proclaimed herself as guardian over her brother she also took a vow of virginity, and her sisters did as well. Pulcheria’s reason for a vow of virginity may have been her deeply religious virtue as recorded by Sozomen: “She devoted her virginity to God, and instructed her sisters to do likewise. To avoid cause of scandal and opportunities for intrigue, she permitted no man to enter her palace. In confirmation of her resolution she took God, the priests, and all the subjects of the Roman empire as witnesses...”[11] Another contemporary of Pulcheria had also described her deep piety. In a letter from Pope Leo I to Pulcheria, he compliments her on her deeply religious ways: In it you clearly show how much you love the Catholic faith and how much you despise the errors of heretics.[12] Along with being deeply pious, it is possible that Pulcheria may have had other motives to take a vow of virginity. According to ancient historians Sozomen, Socrates, and Theodoret, Pulcheria had a deep dislike for Anthemius, the former guardian of Theodosius;[13] the reasons may have been his distaste for her immense power within the empire and her unwillingness to allow Anthemius to gain power amongst the imperial court. A more recent historian, Kenneth Holum, states that Anthemius had tried to make family ties between himself and the imperial family: “Married long since and many years Pulcheria’s senior, Anthemis naturally proposed a descendent or close relative, a grandson perhaps...born a few years earlier than Pulcheria and an excellent prospect for her hand”[14] Pulcheria had found herself in a position where she would have to give her power up to her potential husband, for once a woman in the imperial court married her power was to be relinquished to her husband. In order for Pulcheria to keep her power within the imperial court she took a vow of virginity to ensure that another man could not share her power.Augusta[edit]In 414 the Roman senate made Pulcheria Augusta. During her time as Augusta, Pulcheria held a great deal of power in politics and although she was a woman was treated equally among other men of power. In the senate of Constantinople lay a bust in her honor along with the other Augusti.[15] Many important events occurred during her time as Augusta and her brothers reign as emperor; however, Pulcheria’s influence was mostly in the church. Pulcheria and her brother were known to have harbored anti Jewish sentiment, and both had started to enact laws against Jewish worship in the city of Constantinople. Before the reign of Theodosius II, synagogues were seen as private property and were protected by the imperial government. In Theodosius’s reign he enacted a law that forbade the construction of synagogues, and demanded the destruction of synagogues as well. Pulcheria and Theodosius also ordered that a group of Jews be killed after strife amongst Christians emerged in Palestine.[16] It was well known that Pulcheria had little respect for Jewish people, stemmed by her disapproval of Nestorian theological practices; Kenneth Holum writes “Pulcheria had long nursed a special hatred for Jews, and the Nestorian heresy, which appeared to contemporaries to be of Jewish origin; no doubt had served to confirm that hatred.”[17] Although Pulcheria was known to have strong feelings against pagans and Jews alike, she was known for her philanthropic spirit as well. She had built many churches in and around the city of Constantinople, she had also built many buildings for the poor in the city Sozomen writes that it would take too much time to describe all the churches Pulcheria built, as well as hospitals and inns for the poor.[18] Pulcherias building projects were so vast in Constantinople that a whole district was named in her honor called the Pulcherianai, Some of these establishments were extensive enough to give the names of their proprietors to entire quarters of the city such as the Marina quarter in the second region and the Pulcherianai in the eleventh.[19] As well as contributing to the city with new churches and districts, Pulcheria contributed significantly to the church by bringing back bishops or remains of bishops who had once been dismissed as relics to the church. Pope Leo I describes Pulcherias contributions to the church in a letter to her, ...the entire Roman Church is most grateful to you for all the works of your faith, whether having assisted envoys in every way with devoted affection and for having brought back the Catholic bishops who were ejected from their churches by an unjust sentence, or for having brought back with fitting honor to the church he governed so well the remains of Flavian of holy memory, an innocent and Catholic bishop.[20] Pulcherias time as Augusta was also marked with war and ongoing conflict with Persia. Pulcheria had inspired war against Persia when Persian King Yazdegerd I executed a Christian bishop who destroyed an Zoroastrian altar.[21] Under the influence of Pulcheria, Theodosius sent troops into battle against Persia, the fanaticism over the war by the people of the empire was described by Sozomen as ready to do anything for the sake of Christianity.[21] Pulcheria and Theodosius were victorious in their invasion of Persia, and according to historians Theodosius had credited his sisters vow of virginity as the reason for victory. Surviving letters identify the source of that victory through the vows of his sisters. In his view, when Pulcheria devoted her virginity to God and imposed the same vow on her sisters, she secured Gods favor, causing every threat and war raised against her brother to disperse spontaneously.[22] Theodosius had made his sisters virginity a tool of war propaganda, and because of her vow to be faithful only to God the hand of God would help Roman troops in battle against Persia. Pulcherias power would become even greater after the death of her brother Theodosius II.Aelia Pulcheria (January 19, 398 or 399 – 453) was the daughter of Eastern Roman Emperor Arcadius and Empress Aelia Eudoxia. She was the second child born to Arcadius and Eudoxia. Her older sister was Flaccilla, who was born in 397 but is assumed to have died young. Her younger siblings were Arcadia, born in 400, Theodosius II, the future emperor, and Marina, both born in 401.[1] When her father Arcadius died in 408, her brother Theodosius II was made Emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire, at seven years old. On July 4, 414 a fifteen-year-old Pulcheria proclaimed herself regent over her brother, then thirteen years of age, and made herself Augusta and Empress of the Eastern Roman Empire. According to the ancient historian Sozomen, in his Ecclesiastical History, Pulcheria took a vow of virginity when she became Augusta, and her sisters followed suit. Theodosius II died on July 26, 450, and Pulcheria soon married Marcian on November 25, 450. Marcian and Pulcheria were proclaimed Emperor and Empress of the Eastern Roman Empire. Three years later, in July 453, Pulcheria died; she was later made a saint by the Church.[2] Pulcheria is known to have held a significant amount of power in her brothers reign as emperor.

Pulcheria was also of great influence over the church and theological practices of this time. She had influence over anti-pagan policies, church building projects, and the debate over the Marian title Theotokos (Birth-giver to God).Contents  [hide] 1 Biography1.1 Early life1.2 The Emperors Guardian1.3 Vow of virginity1.4 Augusta1.5 Empress1.5.1 Church conflict1.6 Death2 Relationship with Aelia Eudocia3 Influence over the church4 See also5 Notes6 ReferencesBiography[edit]Early life[edit]Pulcheria was born into the royal House of Theodosius, a dynasty of the later Roman empire, ruling in Constantinople. Her father was Arcadius, and her mother was Aelia Eudoxia. Like Pulcheria, her mother was also powerful and of great influence over the church, however not in the same way Pulcheria was. Arcadius reign was marked by the conflict between his wife and the Bishop of Constantinople,“Although his reign (Arcadius) was short, it is remembered in part for the controversial conflicts Eudoxia encountered with John Chrysostom, bishop of Constantinople from 398 to 404.[3] According to the ancient historian Sozomen, in his Ecclesiastical History, Sozomen claims that much of the rivalry was based on an ornate statue made in the honor of Eudoxia which Chrysostom condemned, “The silver statue of the empress...was placed upon a column of porphyry; and the event was celebrated by loud acclamations, dancing, games, and other manifestations of public rejoicing...John declared that these proceedings reflected dishonor on the church.”[4] According to Sozomen, John had also condemned the empress for her grandiose style of ruling over the empire and condemned her in the church, this of course enraged the empress and John was immediately disposed of. Later in life, Pulcheria would bring back the remains of John Chrysostom and make them into relics for the church, in gratitude for his pious life.[5] Eudoxia died in 404 and the emperor Arcadius died in 408. The emperor left behind four young children, including a seven-year-old Theodosius II. Theodosius was made emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire in 408, immediately after his father died. Two praetorian prefects were selected as regents over Theodosius, one being Anthemius and the other, Antiochus; both took over as regent. Eventually Pulcheria herself would take over as regent for her brother.The Emperors Guardian[edit]Once Pulcheria came of age, at fifteen, she felt, like her brother, that her family had no need for Antiochus any longer; her brother dismissed him of his duties. She then became her own brother’s regent: “In 412 Pulcheria quarreled with Antiochus, who like Anthemius had served the dynasty faithfully for a number of years, and induced her brother to dismiss him from the duties of praepositus. She then took personal charge of the imperial family, directing its affairs with such authority that she became known in society at large as the emperor’s guardian.”[6] Immediately when Pulcheria took authority over the imperial palace, the palace took on a much more monastic tone compared to that of her mother’s palace. Sozomen describes Pulcheria’s and her sisters pious ways in his Ecclesiastical History: “They all pursue the same mode of life; they are sedulous in their attendance in the house of prayer, and evince great charity towards strangers and the poor...and pass their days and their nights together in singing the praises of God.”[7] Rituals within the imperial palace also included chanting and reciting passages in the scripture, and fasting twice a week.[6] The sisters were known to have given up luxurious jewelry and apparel worn by most women of the imperial court of the past. Pulcheria also took on the role of providing all the training necessary for Theodosius to become a successful emperor, once he came of age. Although the empire was technically to be ruled by Theodosius II when he would come of age, his older sister Pulcheria exercised such profound influence over him all his life that she must be considered the co-regent of the empire until her death in 453. In fact it can be said without exaggeration that Pulcheria gave the identity to her brothers reign.[8] Pulcherias training of Theodosius included, ...how an Emperor must walk, and ride his horse, alone or in procession; how he should sit upon his throne: how to wear his Imperial armor and robes; and how to speak with dignity. By no means must he yield to loud laughter...[9] Not only did Pulcheria train her brother on the duties and customs of becoming an Emperor, but she also made sure Theodosius was trained to be a pious Christian leader. Once Theodosius came of age to rule as sole Emperor, according to many historians, the teachings of his sister had been ignored. “He was by nature kind, affable, easily led...Not only was he foolishly kind; he was careless, and often he was to neglect his duty in the administration of his Empire.”[10] This lack of power that Theodosius exemplified led to Pulcheria taking on a much larger role of authority and influence in the Empire.Vow of virginity[edit]At the same time Pulcheria proclaimed herself as guardian over her brother she also took a vow of virginity, and her sisters did as well. Pulcheria’s reason for a vow of virginity may have been her deeply religious virtue as recorded by Sozomen: “She devoted her virginity to God, and instructed her sisters to do likewise. To avoid cause of scandal and opportunities for intrigue, she permitted no man to enter her palace. In confirmation of her resolution she took God, the priests, and all the subjects of the Roman empire as witnesses...”[11] Another contemporary of Pulcheria had also described her deep piety. In a letter from Pope Leo I to Pulcheria, he compliments her on her deeply religious ways: In it you clearly show how much you love the Catholic faith and how much you despise the errors of heretics.[12] Along with being deeply pious, it is possible that Pulcheria may have had other motives to take a vow of virginity. According to ancient historians Sozomen, Socrates, and Theodoret, Pulcheria had a deep dislike for Anthemius, the former guardian of Theodosius;[13] the reasons may have been his distaste for her immense power within the empire and her unwillingness to allow Anthemius to gain power amongst the imperial court. A more recent historian, Kenneth Holum, states that Anthemius had tried to make family ties between himself and the imperial family: “Married long since and many years Pulcheria’s senior, Anthemis naturally proposed a descendent or close relative, a grandson perhaps...born a few years earlier than Pulcheria and an excellent prospect for her hand”[14] Pulcheria had found herself in a position where she would have to give her power up to her potential husband, for once a woman in the imperial court married her power was to be relinquished to her husband. In order for Pulcheria to keep her power within the imperial court she took a vow of virginity to ensure that another man could not share her power.Augusta[edit]In 414 the Roman senate made Pulcheria Augusta. During her time as Augusta, Pulcheria held a great deal of power in politics and although she was a woman was treated equally among other men of power. In the senate of Constantinople lay a bust in her honor along with the other Augusti.[15] Many important events occurred during her time as Augusta and her brothers reign as emperor; however, Pulcheria’s influence was mostly in the church. Pulcheria and her brother were known to have harbored anti Jewish sentiment, and both had started to enact laws against Jewish worship in the city of Constantinople. Before the reign of Theodosius II, synagogues were seen as private property and were protected by the imperial government. In Theodosius’s reign he enacted a law that forbade the construction of synagogues, and demanded the destruction of synagogues as well. Pulcheria and Theodosius also ordered that a group of Jews be killed after strife amongst Christians emerged in Palestine.[16] It was well known that Pulcheria had little respect for Jewish people, stemmed by her disapproval of Nestorian theological practices; Kenneth Holum writes “Pulcheria had long nursed a special hatred for Jews, and the Nestorian heresy, which appeared to contemporaries to be of Jewish origin; no doubt had served to confirm that hatred.”[17] Although Pulcheria was known to have strong feelings against pagans and Jews alike, she was known for her philanthropic spirit as well. She had built many churches in and around the city of Constantinople, she had also built many buildings for the poor in the city Sozomen writes that it would take too much time to describe all the churches Pulcheria built, as well as hospitals and inns for the poor.[18] Pulcherias building projects were so vast in Constantinople that a whole district was named in her honor called the Pulcherianai, Some of these establishments were extensive enough to give the names of their proprietors to entire quarters of the city such as the Marina quarter in the second region and the Pulcherianai in the eleventh.[19] As well as contributing to the city with new churches and districts, Pulcheria contributed significantly to the church by bringing back bishops or remains of bishops who had once been dismissed as relics to the church. Pope Leo I describes Pulcherias contributions to the church in a letter to her, ...the entire Roman Church is most grateful to you for all the works of your faith, whether having assisted envoys in every way with devoted affection and for having brought back the Catholic bishops who were ejected from their churches by an unjust sentence, or for having brought back with fitting honor to the church he governed so well the remains of Flavian of holy memory, an innocent and Catholic bishop.[20] Pulcherias time as Augusta was also marked with war and ongoing conflict with Persia. Pulcheria had inspired war against Persia when Persian King Yazdegerd I executed a Christian bishop who destroyed an Zoroastrian altar.[21] Under the influence of Pulcheria, Theodosius sent troops into battle against Persia, the fanaticism over the war by the people of the empire was described by Sozomen as ready to do anything for the sake of Christianity.[21] Pulcheria and Theodosius were victorious in their invasion of Persia, and according to historians Theodosius had credited his sisters vow of virginity as the reason for victory. Surviving letters identify the source of that victory through the vows of his sisters. In his view, when Pulcheria devoted her virginity to God and imposed the same vow on her sisters, she secured Gods favor, causing every threat and war raised against her brother to disperse spontaneously.[22] Theodosius had made his sisters virginity a tool of war propaganda, and because of her vow to be faithful only to God the hand of God would help Roman troops in battle against Persia. Pulcherias power would become even greater after the death of her brother Theodosius II.Aelia Pulcheria (January 19, 398 or 399 – 453) was the daughter of Eastern Roman Emperor Arcadius and Empress Aelia Eudoxia. She was the second child born to Arcadius and Eudoxia. Her older sister was Flaccilla, who was born in 397 but is assumed to have died young. Her younger siblings were Arcadia, born in 400, Theodosius II, the future emperor, and Marina, both born in 401.[1] When her father Arcadius died in 408, her brother Theodosius II was made Emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire, at seven years old. On July 4, 414 a fifteen-year-old Pulcheria proclaimed herself regent over her brother, then thirteen years of age, and made herself Augusta and Empress of the Eastern Roman Empire. According to the ancient historian Sozomen, in his Ecclesiastical History, Pulcheria took a vow of virginity when she became Augusta, and her sisters followed suit. Theodosius II died on July 26, 450, and Pulcheria soon married Marcian on November 25, 450. Marcian and Pulcheria were proclaimed Emperor and Empress of the Eastern Roman Empire.

Theodosius II died on July 26, 450, and Pulcheria soon married Marcian on November 25, 450. Marcian and Pulcheria were proclaimed Emperor and Empress of the Eastern Roman Empire. Three years later, in July 453, Pulcheria died; she was later made a saint by the Church.[2] Pulcheria is known to have held a significant amount of power in her brothers reign as emperor. Pulcheria was also of great influence over the church and theological practices of this time. She had influence over anti-pagan policies, church building projects, and the debate over the Marian title Theotokos (Birth-giver to God).Contents  [hide] 1 Biography1.1 Early life1.2 The Emperors Guardian1.3 Vow of virginity1.4 Augusta1.5 Empress1.5.1 Church conflict1.6 Death2 Relationship with Aelia Eudocia3 Influence over the church4 See also5 Notes6 ReferencesBiography[edit]Early life[edit]Pulcheria was born into the royal House of Theodosius, a dynasty of the later Roman empire, ruling in Constantinople. Her father was Arcadius, and her mother was Aelia Eudoxia. Like Pulcheria, her mother was also powerful and of great influence over the church, however not in the same way Pulcheria was. Arcadius reign was marked by the conflict between his wife and the Bishop of Constantinople,“Although his reign (Arcadius) was short, it is remembered in part for the controversial conflicts Eudoxia encountered with John Chrysostom, bishop of Constantinople from 398 to 404.[3] According to the ancient historian Sozomen, in his Ecclesiastical History, Sozomen claims that much of the rivalry was based on an ornate statue made in the honor of Eudoxia which Chrysostom condemned, “The silver statue of the empress...was placed upon a column of porphyry; and the event was celebrated by loud acclamations, dancing, games, and other manifestations of public rejoicing...John declared that these proceedings reflected dishonor on the church.”[4] According to Sozomen, John had also condemned the empress for her grandiose style of ruling over the empire and condemned her in the church, this of course enraged the empress and John was immediately disposed of. Later in life, Pulcheria would bring back the remains of John Chrysostom and make them into relics for the church, in gratitude for his pious life.[5] Eudoxia died in 404 and the emperor Arcadius died in 408. The emperor left behind four young children, including a seven-year-old Theodosius II. Theodosius was made emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire in 408, immediately after his father died. Two praetorian prefects were selected as regents over Theodosius, one being Anthemius and the other, Antiochus; both took over as regent. Eventually Pulcheria herself would take over as regent for her brother.The Emperors Guardian[edit]Once Pulcheria came of age, at fifteen, she felt, like her brother, that her family had no need for Antiochus any longer; her brother dismissed him of his duties. She then became her own brother’s regent: “In 412 Pulcheria quarreled with Antiochus, who like Anthemius had served the dynasty faithfully for a number of years, and induced her brother to dismiss him from the duties of praepositus. She then took personal charge of the imperial family, directing its affairs with such authority that she became known in society at large as the emperor’s guardian.”[6] Immediately when Pulcheria took authority over the imperial palace, the palace took on a much more monastic tone compared to that of her mother’s palace. Sozomen describes Pulcheria’s and her sisters pious ways in his Ecclesiastical History: “They all pursue the same mode of life; they are sedulous in their attendance in the house of prayer, and evince great charity towards strangers and the poor...and pass their days and their nights together in singing the praises of God.”[7] Rituals within the imperial palace also included chanting and reciting passages in the scripture, and fasting twice a week.[6] The sisters were known to have given up luxurious jewelry and apparel worn by most women of the imperial court of the past. Pulcheria also took on the role of providing all the training necessary for Theodosius to become a successful emperor, once he came of age. Although the empire was technically to be ruled by Theodosius II when he would come of age, his older sister Pulcheria exercised such profound influence over him all his life that she must be considered the co-regent of the empire until her death in 453. In fact it can be said without exaggeration that Pulcheria gave the identity to her brothers reign.[8] Pulcherias training of Theodosius included, ...how an Emperor must walk, and ride his horse, alone or in procession; how he should sit upon his throne: how to wear his Imperial armor and robes; and how to speak with dignity. By no means must he yield to loud laughter...[9] Not only did Pulcheria train her brother on the duties and customs of becoming an Emperor, but she also made sure Theodosius was trained to be a pious Christian leader. Once Theodosius came of age to rule as sole Emperor, according to many historians, the teachings of his sister had been ignored. “He was by nature kind, affable, easily led...Not only was he foolishly kind; he was careless, and often he was to neglect his duty in the administration of his Empire.”[10] This lack of power that Theodosius exemplified led to Pulcheria taking on a much larger role of authority and influence in the Empire.Vow of virginity[edit]At the same time Pulcheria proclaimed herself as guardian over her brother she also took a vow of virginity, and her sisters did as well. Pulcheria’s reason for a vow of virginity may have been her deeply religious virtue as recorded by Sozomen: “She devoted her virginity to God, and instructed her sisters to do likewise. To avoid cause of scandal and opportunities for intrigue, she permitted no man to enter her palace. In confirmation of her resolution she took God, the priests, and all the subjects of the Roman empire as witnesses...”[11] Another contemporary of Pulcheria had also described her deep piety. In a letter from Pope Leo I to Pulcheria, he compliments her on her deeply religious ways: In it you clearly show how much you love the Catholic faith and how much you despise the errors of heretics.[12] Along with being deeply pious, it is possible that Pulcheria may have had other motives to take a vow of virginity. According to ancient historians Sozomen, Socrates, and Theodoret, Pulcheria had a deep dislike for Anthemius, the former guardian of Theodosius;[13] the reasons may have been his distaste for her immense power within the empire and her unwillingness to allow Anthemius to gain power amongst the imperial court. A more recent historian, Kenneth Holum, states that Anthemius had tried to make family ties between himself and the imperial family: “Married long since and many years Pulcheria’s senior, Anthemis naturally proposed a descendent or close relative, a grandson perhaps...born a few years earlier than Pulcheria and an excellent prospect for her hand”[14] Pulcheria had found herself in a position where she would have to give her power up to her potential husband, for once a woman in the imperial court married her power was to be relinquished to her husband. In order for Pulcheria to keep her power within the imperial court she took a vow of virginity to ensure that another man could not share her power.Augusta[edit]In 414 the Roman senate made Pulcheria Augusta. During her time as Augusta, Pulcheria held a great deal of power in politics and although she was a woman was treated equally among other men of power. In the senate of Constantinople lay a bust in her honor along with the other Augusti.[15] Many important events occurred during her time as Augusta and her brothers reign as emperor; however, Pulcheria’s influence was mostly in the church. Pulcheria and her brother were known to have harbored anti Jewish sentiment, and both had started to enact laws against Jewish worship in the city of Constantinople. Before the reign of Theodosius II, synagogues were seen as private property and were protected by the imperial government. In Theodosius’s reign he enacted a law that forbade the construction of synagogues, and demanded the destruction of synagogues as well. Pulcheria and Theodosius also ordered that a group of Jews be killed after strife amongst Christians emerged in Palestine.[16] It was well known that Pulcheria had little respect for Jewish people, stemmed by her disapproval of Nestorian theological practices; Kenneth Holum writes “Pulcheria had long nursed a special hatred for Jews, and the Nestorian heresy, which appeared to contemporaries to be of Jewish origin; no doubt had served to confirm that hatred.”[17] Although Pulcheria was known to have strong feelings against pagans and Jews alike, she was known for her philanthropic spirit as well. She had built many churches in and around the city of Constantinople, she had also built many buildings for the poor in the city Sozomen writes that it would take too much time to describe all the churches Pulcheria built, as well as hospitals and inns for the poor.[18] Pulcherias building projects were so vast in Constantinople that a whole district was named in her honor called the Pulcherianai, Some of these establishments were extensive enough to give the names of their proprietors to entire quarters of the city such as the Marina quarter in the second region and the Pulcherianai in the eleventh.[19] As well as contributing to the city with new churches and districts, Pulcheria contributed significantly to the church by bringing back bishops or remains of bishops who had once been dismissed as relics to the church. Pope Leo I describes Pulcherias contributions to the church in a letter to her, ...the entire Roman Church is most grateful to you for all the works of your faith, whether having assisted envoys in every way with devoted affection and for having brought back the Catholic bishops who were ejected from their churches by an unjust sentence, or for having brought back with fitting honor to the church he governed so well the remains of Flavian of holy memory, an innocent and Catholic bishop.[20] Pulcherias time as Augusta was also marked with war and ongoing conflict with Persia. Pulcheria had inspired war against Persia when Persian King Yazdegerd I executed a Christian bishop who destroyed an Zoroastrian altar.[21] Under the influence of Pulcheria, Theodosius sent troops into battle against Persia, the fanaticism over the war by the people of the empire was described by Sozomen as ready to do anything for the sake of Christianity.[21] Pulcheria and Theodosius were victorious in their invasion of Persia, and according to historians Theodosius had credited his sisters vow of virginity as the reason for victory. Surviving letters identify the source of that victory through the vows of his sisters. In his view, when Pulcheria devoted her virginity to God and imposed the same vow on her sisters, she secured Gods favor, causing every threat and war raised against her brother to disperse spontaneously.[22] Theodosius had made his sisters virginity a tool of war propaganda, and because of her vow to be faithful only to God the hand of God would help Roman troops in battle against Persia. Pulcherias power would become even greater after the death of her brother Theodosius II.Aelia Pulcheria (January 19, 398 or 399 – 453) was the daughter of Eastern Roman Emperor Arcadius and Empress Aelia Eudoxia. She was the second child born to Arcadius and Eudoxia. Her older sister was Flaccilla, who was born in 397 but is assumed to have died young. Her younger siblings were Arcadia, born in 400, Theodosius II, the future emperor, and Marina, both born in 401.[1] When her father Arcadius died in 408, her brother Theodosius II was made Emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire, at seven years old. On July 4, 414 a fifteen-year-old Pulcheria proclaimed herself regent over her brother, then thirteen years of age, and made herself Augusta and Empress of the Eastern Roman Empire.

According to the ancient historian Sozomen, in his Ecclesiastical History, Pulcheria took a vow of virginity when she became Augusta, and her sisters followed suit. Theodosius II died on July 26, 450, and Pulcheria soon married Marcian on November 25, 450. Marcian and Pulcheria were proclaimed Emperor and Empress of the Eastern Roman Empire. Three years later, in July 453, Pulcheria died; she was later made a saint by the Church.[2] Pulcheria is known to have held a significant amount of power in her brothers reign as emperor. Pulcheria was also of great influence over the church and theological practices of this time. She had influence over anti-pagan policies, church building projects, and the debate over the Marian title Theotokos (Birth-giver to God).Contents  [hide] 1 Biography1.1 Early life1.2 The Emperors Guardian1.3 Vow of virginity1.4 Augusta1.5 Empress1.5.1 Church conflict1.6 Death2 Relationship with Aelia Eudocia3 Influence over the church4 See also5 Notes6 ReferencesBiography[edit]Early life[edit]Pulcheria was born into the royal House of Theodosius, a dynasty of the later Roman empire, ruling in Constantinople. Her father was Arcadius, and her mother was Aelia Eudoxia. Like Pulcheria, her mother was also powerful and of great influence over the church, however not in the same way Pulcheria was. Arcadius reign was marked by the conflict between his wife and the Bishop of Constantinople,“Although his reign (Arcadius) was short, it is remembered in part for the controversial conflicts Eudoxia encountered with John Chrysostom, bishop of Constantinople from 398 to 404.[3] According to the ancient historian Sozomen, in his Ecclesiastical History, Sozomen claims that much of the rivalry was based on an ornate statue made in the honor of Eudoxia which Chrysostom condemned, “The silver statue of the empress...was placed upon a column of porphyry; and the event was celebrated by loud acclamations, dancing, games, and other manifestations of public rejoicing...John declared that these proceedings reflected dishonor on the church.”[4] According to Sozomen, John had also condemned the empress for her grandiose style of ruling over the empire and condemned her in the church, this of course enraged the empress and John was immediately disposed of. Later in life, Pulcheria would bring back the remains of John Chrysostom and make them into relics for the church, in gratitude for his pious life.[5] Eudoxia died in 404 and the emperor Arcadius died in 408. The emperor left behind four young children, including a seven-year-old Theodosius II. Theodosius was made emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire in 408, immediately after his father died. Two praetorian prefects were selected as regents over Theodosius, one being Anthemius and the other, Antiochus; both took over as regent. Eventually Pulcheria herself would take over as regent for her brother.The Emperors Guardian[edit]Once Pulcheria came of age, at fifteen, she felt, like her brother, that her family had no need for Antiochus any longer; her brother dismissed him of his duties. She then became her own brother’s regent: “In 412 Pulcheria quarreled with Antiochus, who like Anthemius had served the dynasty faithfully for a number of years, and induced her brother to dismiss him from the duties of praepositus. She then took personal charge of the imperial family, directing its affairs with such authority that she became known in society at large as the emperor’s guardian.”[6] Immediately when Pulcheria took authority over the imperial palace, the palace took on a much more monastic tone compared to that of her mother’s palace. Sozomen describes Pulcheria’s and her sisters pious ways in his Ecclesiastical History: “They all pursue the same mode of life; they are sedulous in their attendance in the house of prayer, and evince great charity towards strangers and the poor...and pass their days and their nights together in singing the praises of God.”[7] Rituals within the imperial palace also included chanting and reciting passages in the scripture, and fasting twice a week.[6] The sisters were known to have given up luxurious jewelry and apparel worn by most women of the imperial court of the past. Pulcheria also took on the role of providing all the training necessary for Theodosius to become a successful emperor, once he came of age. Although the empire was technically to be ruled by Theodosius II when he would come of age, his older sister Pulcheria exercised such profound influence over him all his life that she must be considered the co-regent of the empire until her death in 453. In fact it can be said without exaggeration that Pulcheria gave the identity to her brothers reign.[8] Pulcherias training of Theodosius included, ...how an Emperor must walk, and ride his horse, alone or in procession; how he should sit upon his throne: how to wear his Imperial armor and robes; and how to speak with dignity. By no means must he yield to loud laughter...[9] Not only did Pulcheria train her brother on the duties and customs of becoming an Emperor, but she also made sure Theodosius was trained to be a pious Christian leader. Once Theodosius came of age to rule as sole Emperor, according to many historians, the teachings of his sister had been ignored. “He was by nature kind, affable, easily led...Not only was he foolishly kind; he was careless, and often he was to neglect his duty in the administration of his Empire.”[10] This lack of power that Theodosius exemplified led to Pulcheria taking on a much larger role of authority and influence in the Empire.Vow of virginity[edit]At the same time Pulcheria proclaimed herself as guardian over her brother she also took a vow of virginity, and her sisters did as well. Pulcheria’s reason for a vow of virginity may have been her deeply religious virtue as recorded by Sozomen: “She devoted her virginity to God, and instructed her sisters to do likewise. To avoid cause of scandal and opportunities for intrigue, she permitted no man to enter her palace. In confirmation of her resolution she took God, the priests, and all the subjects of the Roman empire as witnesses...”[11] Another contemporary of Pulcheria had also described her deep piety. In a letter from Pope Leo I to Pulcheria, he compliments her on her deeply religious ways: In it you clearly show how much you love the Catholic faith and how much you despise the errors of heretics.[12] Along with being deeply pious, it is possible that Pulcheria may have had other motives to take a vow of virginity. According to ancient historians Sozomen, Socrates, and Theodoret, Pulcheria had a deep dislike for Anthemius, the former guardian of Theodosius;[13] the reasons may have been his distaste for her immense power within the empire and her unwillingness to allow Anthemius to gain power amongst the imperial court. A more recent historian, Kenneth Holum, states that Anthemius had tried to make family ties between himself and the imperial family: “Married long since and many years Pulcheria’s senior, Anthemis naturally proposed a descendent or close relative, a grandson perhaps...born a few years earlier than Pulcheria and an excellent prospect for her hand”[14] Pulcheria had found herself in a position where she would have to give her power up to her potential husband, for once a woman in the imperial court married her power was to be relinquished to her husband. In order for Pulcheria to keep her power within the imperial court she took a vow of virginity to ensure that another man could not share her power.Augusta[edit]In 414 the Roman senate made Pulcheria Augusta. During her time as Augusta, Pulcheria held a great deal of power in politics and although she was a woman was treated equally among other men of power. In the senate of Constantinople lay a bust in her honor along with the other Augusti.[15] Many important events occurred during her time as Augusta and her brothers reign as emperor; however, Pulcheria’s influence was mostly in the church. Pulcheria and her brother were known to have harbored anti Jewish sentiment, and both had started to enact laws against Jewish worship in the city of Constantinople. Before the reign of Theodosius II, synagogues were seen as private property and were protected by the imperial government. In Theodosius’s reign he enacted a law that forbade the construction of synagogues, and demanded the destruction of synagogues as well. Pulcheria and Theodosius also ordered that a group of Jews be killed after strife amongst Christians emerged in Palestine.[16] It was well known that Pulcheria had little respect for Jewish people, stemmed by her disapproval of Nestorian theological practices; Kenneth Holum writes “Pulcheria had long nursed a special hatred for Jews, and the Nestorian heresy, which appeared to contemporaries to be of Jewish origin; no doubt had served to confirm that hatred.”[17] Although Pulcheria was known to have strong feelings against pagans and Jews alike, she was known for her philanthropic spirit as well. She had built many churches in and around the city of Constantinople, she had also built many buildings for the poor in the city Sozomen writes that it would take too much time to describe all the churches Pulcheria built, as well as hospitals and inns for the poor.[18] Pulcherias building projects were so vast in Constantinople that a whole district was named in her honor called the Pulcherianai, Some of these establishments were extensive enough to give the names of their proprietors to entire quarters of the city such as the Marina quarter in the second region and the Pulcherianai in the eleventh.[19] As well as contributing to the city with new churches and districts, Pulcheria contributed significantly to the church by bringing back bishops or remains of bishops who had once been dismissed as relics to the church. Pope Leo I describes Pulcherias contributions to the church in a letter to her, ...the entire Roman Church is most grateful to you for all the works of your faith, whether having assisted envoys in every way with devoted affection and for having brought back the Catholic bishops who were ejected from their churches by an unjust sentence, or for having brought back with fitting honor to the church he governed so well the remains of Flavian of holy memory, an innocent and Catholic bishop.[20] Pulcherias time as Augusta was also marked with war and ongoing conflict with Persia. Pulcheria had inspired war against Persia when Persian King Yazdegerd I executed a Christian bishop who destroyed an Zoroastrian altar.[21] Under the influence of Pulcheria, Theodosius sent troops into battle against Persia, the fanaticism over the war by the people of the empire was described by Sozomen as ready to do anything for the sake of Christianity.[21] Pulcheria and Theodosius were victorious in their invasion of Persia, and according to historians Theodosius had credited his sisters vow of virginity as the reason for victory. Surviving letters identify the source of that victory through the vows of his sisters. In his view, when Pulcheria devoted her virginity to God and imposed the same vow on her sisters, she secured Gods favor, causing every threat and war raised against her brother to disperse spontaneously.[22] Theodosius had made his sisters virginity a tool of war propaganda, and because of her vow to be faithful only to God the hand of God would help Roman troops in battle against Persia. Pulcherias power would become even greater after the death of her brother Theodosius II.Aelia Pulcheria (January 19, 398 or 399 – 453) was the daughter of Eastern Roman Emperor Arcadius and Empress Aelia Eudoxia. She was the second child born to Arcadius and Eudoxia. Her older sister was Flaccilla, who was born in 397 but is assumed to have died young. Her younger siblings were Arcadia, born in 400, Theodosius II, the future emperor, and Marina, both born in 401.[1] When her father Arcadius died in 408, her brother Theodosius II was made Emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire, at seven years old.

Her younger siblings were Arcadia, born in 400, Theodosius II, the future emperor, and Marina, both born in 401.[1] When her father Arcadius died in 408, her brother Theodosius II was made Emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire, at seven years old. On July 4, 414 a fifteen-year-old Pulcheria proclaimed herself regent over her brother, then thirteen years of age, and made herself Augusta and Empress of the Eastern Roman Empire. According to the ancient historian Sozomen, in his Ecclesiastical History, Pulcheria took a vow of virginity when she became Augusta, and her sisters followed suit. Theodosius II died on July 26, 450, and Pulcheria soon married Marcian on November 25, 450. Marcian and Pulcheria were proclaimed Emperor and Empress of the Eastern Roman Empire. Three years later, in July 453, Pulcheria died; she was later made a saint by the Church.[2] Pulcheria is known to have held a significant amount of power in her brothers reign as emperor. Pulcheria was also of great influence over the church and theological practices of this time. She had influence over anti-pagan policies, church building projects, and the debate over the Marian title Theotokos (Birth-giver to God).Contents  [hide] 1 Biography1.1 Early life1.2 The Emperors Guardian1.3 Vow of virginity1.4 Augusta1.5 Empress1.5.1 Church conflict1.6 Death2 Relationship with Aelia Eudocia3 Influence over the church4 See also5 Notes6 ReferencesBiography[edit]Early life[edit]Pulcheria was born into the royal House of Theodosius, a dynasty of the later Roman empire, ruling in Constantinople. Her father was Arcadius, and her mother was Aelia Eudoxia. Like Pulcheria, her mother was also powerful and of great influence over the church, however not in the same way Pulcheria was. Arcadius reign was marked by the conflict between his wife and the Bishop of Constantinople,“Although his reign (Arcadius) was short, it is remembered in part for the controversial conflicts Eudoxia encountered with John Chrysostom, bishop of Constantinople from 398 to 404.[3] According to the ancient historian Sozomen, in his Ecclesiastical History, Sozomen claims that much of the rivalry was based on an ornate statue made in the honor of Eudoxia which Chrysostom condemned, “The silver statue of the empress...was placed upon a column of porphyry; and the event was celebrated by loud acclamations, dancing, games, and other manifestations of public rejoicing...John declared that these proceedings reflected dishonor on the church.”[4] According to Sozomen, John had also condemned the empress for her grandiose style of ruling over the empire and condemned her in the church, this of course enraged the empress and John was immediately disposed of. Later in life, Pulcheria would bring back the remains of John Chrysostom and make them into relics for the church, in gratitude for his pious life.[5] Eudoxia died in 404 and the emperor Arcadius died in 408. The emperor left behind four young children, including a seven-year-old Theodosius II. Theodosius was made emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire in 408, immediately after his father died. Two praetorian prefects were selected as regents over Theodosius, one being Anthemius and the other, Antiochus; both took over as regent. Eventually Pulcheria herself would take over as regent for her brother.The Emperors Guardian[edit]Once Pulcheria came of age, at fifteen, she felt, like her brother, that her family had no need for Antiochus any longer; her brother dismissed him of his duties. She then became her own brother’s regent: “In 412 Pulcheria quarreled with Antiochus, who like Anthemius had served the dynasty faithfully for a number of years, and induced her brother to dismiss him from the duties of praepositus. She then took personal charge of the imperial family, directing its affairs with such authority that she became known in society at large as the emperor’s guardian.”[6] Immediately when Pulcheria took authority over the imperial palace, the palace took on a much more monastic tone compared to that of her mother’s palace. Sozomen describes Pulcheria’s and her sisters pious ways in his Ecclesiastical History: “They all pursue the same mode of life; they are sedulous in their attendance in the house of prayer, and evince great charity towards strangers and the poor...and pass their days and their nights together in singing the praises of God.”[7] Rituals within the imperial palace also included chanting and reciting passages in the scripture, and fasting twice a week.[6] The sisters were known to have given up luxurious jewelry and apparel worn by most women of the imperial court of the past. Pulcheria also took on the role of providing all the training necessary for Theodosius to become a successful emperor, once he came of age. Although the empire was technically to be ruled by Theodosius II when he would come of age, his older sister Pulcheria exercised such profound influence over him all his life that she must be considered the co-regent of the empire until her death in 453. In fact it can be said without exaggeration that Pulcheria gave the identity to her brothers reign.[8] Pulcherias training of Theodosius included, ...how an Emperor must walk, and ride his horse, alone or in procession; how he should sit upon his throne: how to wear his Imperial armor and robes; and how to speak with dignity. By no means must he yield to loud laughter...[9] Not only did Pulcheria train her brother on the duties and customs of becoming an Emperor, but she also made sure Theodosius was trained to be a pious Christian leader. Once Theodosius came of age to rule as sole Emperor, according to many historians, the teachings of his sister had been ignored. “He was by nature kind, affable, easily led...Not only was he foolishly kind; he was careless, and often he was to neglect his duty in the administration of his Empire.”[10] This lack of power that Theodosius exemplified led to Pulcheria taking on a much larger role of authority and influence in the Empire.Vow of virginity[edit]At the same time Pulcheria proclaimed herself as guardian over her brother she also took a vow of virginity, and her sisters did as well. Pulcheria’s reason for a vow of virginity may have been her deeply religious virtue as recorded by Sozomen: “She devoted her virginity to God, and instructed her sisters to do likewise. To avoid cause of scandal and opportunities for intrigue, she permitted no man to enter her palace. In confirmation of her resolution she took God, the priests, and all the subjects of the Roman empire as witnesses...”[11] Another contemporary of Pulcheria had also described her deep piety. In a letter from Pope Leo I to Pulcheria, he compliments her on her deeply religious ways: In it you clearly show how much you love the Catholic faith and how much you despise the errors of heretics.[12] Along with being deeply pious, it is possible that Pulcheria may have had other motives to take a vow of virginity. According to ancient historians Sozomen, Socrates, and Theodoret, Pulcheria had a deep dislike for Anthemius, the former guardian of Theodosius;[13] the reasons may have been his distaste for her immense power within the empire and her unwillingness to allow Anthemius to gain power amongst the imperial court. A more recent historian, Kenneth Holum, states that Anthemius had tried to make family ties between himself and the imperial family: “Married long since and many years Pulcheria’s senior, Anthemis naturally proposed a descendent or close relative, a grandson perhaps...born a few years earlier than Pulcheria and an excellent prospect for her hand”[14] Pulcheria had found herself in a position where she would have to give her power up to her potential husband, for once a woman in the imperial court married her power was to be relinquished to her husband. In order for Pulcheria to keep her power within the imperial court she took a vow of virginity to ensure that another man could not share her power.Augusta[edit]In 414 the Roman senate made Pulcheria Augusta. During her time as Augusta, Pulcheria held a great deal of power in politics and although she was a woman was treated equally among other men of power. In the senate of Constantinople lay a bust in her honor along with the other Augusti.[15] Many important events occurred during her time as Augusta and her brothers reign as emperor; however, Pulcheria’s influence was mostly in the church. Pulcheria and her brother were known to have harbored anti Jewish sentiment, and both had started to enact laws against Jewish worship in the city of Constantinople. Before the reign of Theodosius II, synagogues were seen as private property and were protected by the imperial government. In Theodosius’s reign he enacted a law that forbade the construction of synagogues, and demanded the destruction of synagogues as well. Pulcheria and Theodosius also ordered that a group of Jews be killed after strife amongst Christians emerged in Palestine.[16] It was well known that Pulcheria had little respect for Jewish people, stemmed by her disapproval of Nestorian theological practices; Kenneth Holum writes “Pulcheria had long nursed a special hatred for Jews, and the Nestorian heresy, which appeared to contemporaries to be of Jewish origin; no doubt had served to confirm that hatred.”[17] Although Pulcheria was known to have strong feelings against pagans and Jews alike, she was known for her philanthropic spirit as well. She had built many churches in and around the city of Constantinople, she had also built many buildings for the poor in the city Sozomen writes that it would take too much time to describe all the churches Pulcheria built, as well as hospitals and inns for the poor.[18] Pulcherias building projects were so vast in Constantinople that a whole district was named in her honor called the Pulcherianai, Some of these establishments were extensive enough to give the names of their proprietors to entire quarters of the city such as the Marina quarter in the second region and the Pulcherianai in the eleventh.[19] As well as contributing to the city with new churches and districts, Pulcheria contributed significantly to the church by bringing back bishops or remains of bishops who had once been dismissed as relics to the church. Pope Leo I describes Pulcherias contributions to the church in a letter to her, ...the entire Roman Church is most grateful to you for all the works of your faith, whether having assisted envoys in every way with devoted affection and for having brought back the Catholic bishops who were ejected from their churches by an unjust sentence, or for having brought back with fitting honor to the church he governed so well the remains of Flavian of holy memory, an innocent and Catholic bishop.[20] Pulcherias time as Augusta was also marked with war and ongoing conflict with Persia. Pulcheria had inspired war against Persia when Persian King Yazdegerd I executed a Christian bishop who destroyed an Zoroastrian altar.[21] Under the influence of Pulcheria, Theodosius sent troops into battle against Persia, the fanaticism over the war by the people of the empire was described by Sozomen as ready to do anything for the sake of Christianity.[21] Pulcheria and Theodosius were victorious in their invasion of Persia, and according to historians Theodosius had credited his sisters vow of virginity as the reason for victory. Surviving letters identify the source of that victory through the vows of his sisters. In his view, when Pulcheria devoted her virginity to God and imposed the same vow on her sisters, she secured Gods favor, causing every threat and war raised against her brother to disperse spontaneously.[22] Theodosius had made his sisters virginity a tool of war propaganda, and because of her vow to be faithful only to God the hand of God would help Roman troops in battle against Persia. Pulcherias power would become even greater after the death of her brother Theodosius II.Aelia Pulcheria (January 19, 398 or 399 – 453) was the daughter of Eastern Roman Emperor Arcadius and Empress Aelia Eudoxia.

Pulcherias power would become even greater after the death of her brother Theodosius II.Aelia Pulcheria (January 19, 398 or 399 – 453) was the daughter of Eastern Roman Emperor Arcadius and Empress Aelia Eudoxia. She was the second child born to Arcadius and Eudoxia. Her older sister was Flaccilla, who was born in 397 but is assumed to have died young. Her younger siblings were Arcadia, born in 400, Theodosius II, the future emperor, and Marina, both born in 401.[1] When her father Arcadius died in 408, her brother Theodosius II was made Emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire, at seven years old. On July 4, 414 a fifteen-year-old Pulcheria proclaimed herself regent over her brother, then thirteen years of age, and made herself Augusta and Empress of the Eastern Roman Empire. According to the ancient historian Sozomen, in his Ecclesiastical History, Pulcheria took a vow of virginity when she became Augusta, and her sisters followed suit. Theodosius II died on July 26, 450, and Pulcheria soon married Marcian on November 25, 450. Marcian and Pulcheria were proclaimed Emperor and Empress of the Eastern Roman Empire. Three years later, in July 453, Pulcheria died; she was later made a saint by the Church.[2] Pulcheria is known to have held a significant amount of power in her brothers reign as emperor. Pulcheria was also of great influence over the church and theological practices of this time. She had influence over anti-pagan policies, church building projects, and the debate over the Marian title Theotokos (Birth-giver to God).Contents  [hide] 1 Biography1.1 Early life1.2 The Emperors Guardian1.3 Vow of virginity1.4 Augusta1.5 Empress1.5.1 Church conflict1.6 Death2 Relationship with Aelia Eudocia3 Influence over the church4 See also5 Notes6 ReferencesBiography[edit]Early life[edit]Pulcheria was born into the royal House of Theodosius, a dynasty of the later Roman empire, ruling in Constantinople. Her father was Arcadius, and her mother was Aelia Eudoxia. Like Pulcheria, her mother was also powerful and of great influence over the church, however not in the same way Pulcheria was. Arcadius reign was marked by the conflict between his wife and the Bishop of Constantinople,“Although his reign (Arcadius) was short, it is remembered in part for the controversial conflicts Eudoxia encountered with John Chrysostom, bishop of Constantinople from 398 to 404.[3] According to the ancient historian Sozomen, in his Ecclesiastical History, Sozomen claims that much of the rivalry was based on an ornate statue made in the honor of Eudoxia which Chrysostom condemned, “The silver statue of the empress...was placed upon a column of porphyry; and the event was celebrated by loud acclamations, dancing, games, and other manifestations of public rejoicing...John declared that these proceedings reflected dishonor on the church.”[4] According to Sozomen, John had also condemned the empress for her grandiose style of ruling over the empire and condemned her in the church, this of course enraged the empress and John was immediately disposed of. Later in life, Pulcheria would bring back the remains of John Chrysostom and make them into relics for the church, in gratitude for his pious life.[5] Eudoxia died in 404 and the emperor Arcadius died in 408. The emperor left behind four young children, including a seven-year-old Theodosius II. Theodosius was made emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire in 408, immediately after his father died. Two praetorian prefects were selected as regents over Theodosius, one being Anthemius and the other, Antiochus; both took over as regent. Eventually Pulcheria herself would take over as regent for her brother.The Emperors Guardian[edit]Once Pulcheria came of age, at fifteen, she felt, like her brother, that her family had no need for Antiochus any longer; her brother dismissed him of his duties. She then became her own brother’s regent: “In 412 Pulcheria quarreled with Antiochus, who like Anthemius had served the dynasty faithfully for a number of years, and induced her brother to dismiss him from the duties of praepositus. She then took personal charge of the imperial family, directing its affairs with such authority that she became known in society at large as the emperor’s guardian.”[6] Immediately when Pulcheria took authority over the imperial palace, the palace took on a much more monastic tone compared to that of her mother’s palace. Sozomen describes Pulcheria’s and her sisters pious ways in his Ecclesiastical History: “They all pursue the same mode of life; they are sedulous in their attendance in the house of prayer, and evince great charity towards strangers and the poor...and pass their days and their nights together in singing the praises of God.”[7] Rituals within the imperial palace also included chanting and reciting passages in the scripture, and fasting twice a week.[6] The sisters were known to have given up luxurious jewelry and apparel worn by most women of the imperial court of the past. Pulcheria also took on the role of providing all the training necessary for Theodosius to become a successful emperor, once he came of age. Although the empire was technically to be ruled by Theodosius II when he would come of age, his older sister Pulcheria exercised such profound influence over him all his life that she must be considered the co-regent of the empire until her death in 453. In fact it can be said without exaggeration that Pulcheria gave the identity to her brothers reign.[8] Pulcherias training of Theodosius included, ...how an Emperor must walk, and ride his horse, alone or in procession; how he should sit upon his throne: how to wear his Imperial armor and robes; and how to speak with dignity. By no means must he yield to loud laughter...[9] Not only did Pulcheria train her brother on the duties and customs of becoming an Emperor, but she also made sure Theodosius was trained to be a pious Christian leader. Once Theodosius came of age to rule as sole Emperor, according to many historians, the teachings of his sister had been ignored. “He was by nature kind, affable, easily led...Not only was he foolishly kind; he was careless, and often he was to neglect his duty in the administration of his Empire.”[10] This lack of power that Theodosius exemplified led to Pulcheria taking on a much larger role of authority and influence in the Empire.Vow of virginity[edit]At the same time Pulcheria proclaimed herself as guardian over her brother she also took a vow of virginity, and her sisters did as well. Pulcheria’s reason for a vow of virginity may have been her deeply religious virtue as recorded by Sozomen: “She devoted her virginity to God, and instructed her sisters to do likewise. To avoid cause of scandal and opportunities for intrigue, she permitted no man to enter her palace. In confirmation of her resolution she took God, the priests, and all the subjects of the Roman empire as witnesses...”[11] Another contemporary of Pulcheria had also described her deep piety. In a letter from Pope Leo I to Pulcheria, he compliments her on her deeply religious ways: In it you clearly show how much you love the Catholic faith and how much you despise the errors of heretics.[12] Along with being deeply pious, it is possible that Pulcheria may have had other motives to take a vow of virginity. According to ancient historians Sozomen, Socrates, and Theodoret, Pulcheria had a deep dislike for Anthemius, the former guardian of Theodosius;[13] the reasons may have been his distaste for her immense power within the empire and her unwillingness to allow Anthemius to gain power amongst the imperial court. A more recent historian, Kenneth Holum, states that Anthemius had tried to make family ties between himself and the imperial family: “Married long since and many years Pulcheria’s senior, Anthemis naturally proposed a descendent or close relative, a grandson perhaps...born a few years earlier than Pulcheria and an excellent prospect for her hand”[14] Pulcheria had found herself in a position where she would have to give her power up to her potential husband, for once a woman in the imperial court married her power was to be relinquished to her husband. In order for Pulcheria to keep her power within the imperial court she took a vow of virginity to ensure that another man could not share her power.Augusta[edit]In 414 the Roman senate made Pulcheria Augusta. During her time as Augusta, Pulcheria held a great deal of power in politics and although she was a woman was treated equally among other men of power. In the senate of Constantinople lay a bust in her honor along with the other Augusti.[15] Many important events occurred during her time as Augusta and her brothers reign as emperor; however, Pulcheria’s influence was mostly in the church. Pulcheria and her brother were known to have harbored anti Jewish sentiment, and both had started to enact laws against Jewish worship in the city of Constantinople. Before the reign of Theodosius II, synagogues were seen as private property and were protected by the imperial government. In Theodosius’s reign he enacted a law that forbade the construction of synagogues, and demanded the destruction of synagogues as well. Pulcheria and Theodosius also ordered that a group of Jews be killed after strife amongst Christians emerged in Palestine.[16] It was well known that Pulcheria had little respect for Jewish people, stemmed by her disapproval of Nestorian theological practices; Kenneth Holum writes “Pulcheria had long nursed a special hatred for Jews, and the Nestorian heresy, which appeared to contemporaries to be of Jewish origin; no doubt had served to confirm that hatred.”[17] Although Pulcheria was known to have strong feelings against pagans and Jews alike, she was known for her philanthropic spirit as well. She had built many churches in and around the city of Constantinople, she had also built many buildings for the poor in the city Sozomen writes that it would take too much time to describe all the churches Pulcheria built, as well as hospitals and inns for the poor.[18] Pulcherias building projects were so vast in Constantinople that a whole district was named in her honor called the Pulcherianai, Some of these establishments were extensive enough to give the names of their proprietors to entire quarters of the city such as the Marina quarter in the second region and the Pulcherianai in the eleventh.[19] As well as contributing to the city with new churches and districts, Pulcheria contributed significantly to the church by bringing back bishops or remains of bishops who had once been dismissed as relics to the church. Pope Leo I describes Pulcherias contributions to the church in a letter to her, ...the entire Roman Church is most grateful to you for all the works of your faith, whether having assisted envoys in every way with devoted affection and for having brought back the Catholic bishops who were ejected from their churches by an unjust sentence, or for having brought back with fitting honor to the church he governed so well the remains of Flavian of holy memory, an innocent and Catholic bishop.[20] Pulcherias time as Augusta was also marked with war and ongoing conflict with Persia. Pulcheria had inspired war against Persia when Persian King Yazdegerd I executed a Christian bishop who destroyed an Zoroastrian altar.[21] Under the influence of Pulcheria, Theodosius sent troops into battle against Persia, the fanaticism over the war by the people of the empire was described by Sozomen as ready to do anything for the sake of Christianity.[21] Pulcheria and Theodosius were victorious in their invasion of Persia, and according to historians Theodosius had credited his sisters vow of virginity as the reason for victory. Surviving letters identify the source of that victory through the vows of his sisters. In his view, when Pulcheria devoted her virginity to God and imposed the same vow on her sisters, she secured Gods favor, causing every threat and war raised against her brother to disperse spontaneously.[22] Theodosius had made his sisters virginity a tool of war propaganda, and because of her vow to be faithful only to God the hand of God would help Roman troops in battle against Persia.

In his view, when Pulcheria devoted her virginity to God and imposed the same vow on her sisters, she secured Gods favor, causing every threat and war raised against her brother to disperse spontaneously.[22] Theodosius had made his sisters virginity a tool of war propaganda, and because of her vow to be faithful only to God the hand of God would help Roman troops in battle against Persia. Pulcherias power would become even greater after the death of her brother Theodosius II.Aelia Pulcheria (January 19, 398 or 399 – 453) was the daughter of Eastern Roman Emperor Arcadius and Empress Aelia Eudoxia. She was the second child born to Arcadius and Eudoxia. Her older sister was Flaccilla, who was born in 397 but is assumed to have died young. Her younger siblings were Arcadia, born in 400, Theodosius II, the future emperor, and Marina, both born in 401.[1] When her father Arcadius died in 408, her brother Theodosius II was made Emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire, at seven years old. On July 4, 414 a fifteen-year-old Pulcheria proclaimed herself regent over her brother, then thirteen years of age, and made herself Augusta and Empress of the Eastern Roman Empire. According to the ancient historian Sozomen, in his Ecclesiastical History, Pulcheria took a vow of virginity when she became Augusta, and her sisters followed suit. Theodosius II died on July 26, 450, and Pulcheria soon married Marcian on November 25, 450. Marcian and Pulcheria were proclaimed Emperor and Empress of the Eastern Roman Empire. Three years later, in July 453, Pulcheria died; she was later made a saint by the Church.[2] Pulcheria is known to have held a significant amount of power in her brothers reign as emperor. Pulcheria was also of great influence over the church and theological practices of this time. She had influence over anti-pagan policies, church building projects, and the debate over the Marian title Theotokos (Birth-giver to God).Contents  [hide] 1 Biography1.1 Early life1.2 The Emperors Guardian1.3 Vow of virginity1.4 Augusta1.5 Empress1.5.1 Church conflict1.6 Death2 Relationship with Aelia Eudocia3 Influence over the church4 See also5 Notes6 ReferencesBiography[edit]Early life[edit]Pulcheria was born into the royal House of Theodosius, a dynasty of the later Roman empire, ruling in Constantinople. Her father was Arcadius, and her mother was Aelia Eudoxia. Like Pulcheria, her mother was also powerful and of great influence over the church, however not in the same way Pulcheria was. Arcadius reign was marked by the conflict between his wife and the Bishop of Constantinople,“Although his reign (Arcadius) was short, it is remembered in part for the controversial conflicts Eudoxia encountered with John Chrysostom, bishop of Constantinople from 398 to 404.[3] According to the ancient historian Sozomen, in his Ecclesiastical History, Sozomen claims that much of the rivalry was based on an ornate statue made in the honor of Eudoxia which Chrysostom condemned, “The silver statue of the empress...was placed upon a column of porphyry; and the event was celebrated by loud acclamations, dancing, games, and other manifestations of public rejoicing...John declared that these proceedings reflected dishonor on the church.”[4] According to Sozomen, John had also condemned the empress for her grandiose style of ruling over the empire and condemned her in the church, this of course enraged the empress and John was immediately disposed of. Later in life, Pulcheria would bring back the remains of John Chrysostom and make them into relics for the church, in gratitude for his pious life.[5] Eudoxia died in 404 and the emperor Arcadius died in 408. The emperor left behind four young children, including a seven-year-old Theodosius II. Theodosius was made emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire in 408, immediately after his father died. Two praetorian prefects were selected as regents over Theodosius, one being Anthemius and the other, Antiochus; both took over as regent. Eventually Pulcheria herself would take over as regent for her brother.The Emperors Guardian[edit]Once Pulcheria came of age, at fifteen, she felt, like her brother, that her family had no need for Antiochus any longer; her brother dismissed him of his duties. She then became her own brother’s regent: “In 412 Pulcheria quarreled with Antiochus, who like Anthemius had served the dynasty faithfully for a number of years, and induced her brother to dismiss him from the duties of praepositus. She then took personal charge of the imperial family, directing its affairs with such authority that she became known in society at large as the emperor’s guardian.”[6] Immediately when Pulcheria took authority over the imperial palace, the palace took on a much more monastic tone compared to that of her mother’s palace. Sozomen describes Pulcheria’s and her sisters pious ways in his Ecclesiastical History: “They all pursue the same mode of life; they are sedulous in their attendance in the house of prayer, and evince great charity towards strangers and the poor...and pass their days and their nights together in singing the praises of God.”[7] Rituals within the imperial palace also included chanting and reciting passages in the scripture, and fasting twice a week.[6] The sisters were known to have given up luxurious jewelry and apparel worn by most women of the imperial court of the past. Pulcheria also took on the role of providing all the training necessary for Theodosius to become a successful emperor, once he came of age. Although the empire was technically to be ruled by Theodosius II when he would come of age, his older sister Pulcheria exercised such profound influence over him all his life that she must be considered the co-regent of the empire until her death in 453. In fact it can be said without exaggeration that Pulcheria gave the identity to her brothers reign.[8] Pulcherias training of Theodosius included, ...how an Emperor must walk, and ride his horse, alone or in procession; how he should sit upon his throne: how to wear his Imperial armor and robes; and how to speak with dignity. By no means must he yield to loud laughter...[9] Not only did Pulcheria train her brother on the duties and customs of becoming an Emperor, but she also made sure Theodosius was trained to be a pious Christian leader. Once Theodosius came of age to rule as sole Emperor, according to many historians, the teachings of his sister had been ignored. “He was by nature kind, affable, easily led...Not only was he foolishly kind; he was careless, and often he was to neglect his duty in the administration of his Empire.”[10] This lack of power that Theodosius exemplified led to Pulcheria taking on a much larger role of authority and influence in the Empire.Vow of virginity[edit]At the same time Pulcheria proclaimed herself as guardian over her brother she also took a vow of virginity, and her sisters did as well. Pulcheria’s reason for a vow of virginity may have been her deeply religious virtue as recorded by Sozomen: “She devoted her virginity to God, and instructed her sisters to do likewise. To avoid cause of scandal and opportunities for intrigue, she permitted no man to enter her palace. In confirmation of her resolution she took God, the priests, and all the subjects of the Roman empire as witnesses...”[11] Another contemporary of Pulcheria had also described her deep piety. In a letter from Pope Leo I to Pulcheria, he compliments her on her deeply religious ways: In it you clearly show how much you love the Catholic faith and how much you despise the errors of heretics.[12] Along with being deeply pious, it is possible that Pulcheria may have had other motives to take a vow of virginity. According to ancient historians Sozomen, Socrates, and Theodoret, Pulcheria had a deep dislike for Anthemius, the former guardian of Theodosius;[13] the reasons may have been his distaste for her immense power within the empire and her unwillingness to allow Anthemius to gain power amongst the imperial court. A more recent historian, Kenneth Holum, states that Anthemius had tried to make family ties between himself and the imperial family: “Married long since and many years Pulcheria’s senior, Anthemis naturally proposed a descendent or close relative, a grandson perhaps...born a few years earlier than Pulcheria and an excellent prospect for her hand”[14] Pulcheria had found herself in a position where she would have to give her power up to her potential husband, for once a woman in the imperial court married her power was to be relinquished to her husband. In order for Pulcheria to keep her power within the imperial court she took a vow of virginity to ensure that another man could not share her power.Augusta[edit]In 414 the Roman senate made Pulcheria Augusta. During her time as Augusta, Pulcheria held a great deal of power in politics and although she was a woman was treated equally among other men of power. In the senate of Constantinople lay a bust in her honor along with the other Augusti.[15] Many important events occurred during her time as Augusta and her brothers reign as emperor; however, Pulcheria’s influence was mostly in the church. Pulcheria and her brother were known to have harbored anti Jewish sentiment, and both had started to enact laws against Jewish worship in the city of Constantinople. Before the reign of Theodosius II, synagogues were seen as private property and were protected by the imperial government. In Theodosius’s reign he enacted a law that forbade the construction of synagogues, and demanded the destruction of synagogues as well. Pulcheria and Theodosius also ordered that a group of Jews be killed after strife amongst Christians emerged in Palestine.[16] It was well known that Pulcheria had little respect for Jewish people, stemmed by her disapproval of Nestorian theological practices; Kenneth Holum writes “Pulcheria had long nursed a special hatred for Jews, and the Nestorian heresy, which appeared to contemporaries to be of Jewish origin; no doubt had served to confirm that hatred.”[17] Although Pulcheria was known to have strong feelings against pagans and Jews alike, she was known for her philanthropic spirit as well. She had built many churches in and around the city of Constantinople, she had also built many buildings for the poor in the city Sozomen writes that it would take too much time to describe all the churches Pulcheria built, as well as hospitals and inns for the poor.[18] Pulcherias building projects were so vast in Constantinople that a whole district was named in her honor called the Pulcherianai, Some of these establishments were extensive enough to give the names of their proprietors to entire quarters of the city such as the Marina quarter in the second region and the Pulcherianai in the eleventh.[19] As well as contributing to the city with new churches and districts, Pulcheria contributed significantly to the church by bringing back bishops or remains of bishops who had once been dismissed as relics to the church. Pope Leo I describes Pulcherias contributions to the church in a letter to her, ...the entire Roman Church is most grateful to you for all the works of your faith, whether having assisted envoys in every way with devoted affection and for having brought back the Catholic bishops who were ejected from their churches by an unjust sentence, or for having brought back with fitting honor to the church he governed so well the remains of Flavian of holy memory, an innocent and Catholic bishop.[20] Pulcherias time as Augusta was also marked with war and ongoing conflict with Persia. Pulcheria had inspired war against Persia when Persian King Yazdegerd I executed a Christian bishop who destroyed an Zoroastrian altar.[21] Under the influence of Pulcheria, Theodosius sent troops into battle against Persia, the fanaticism over the war by the people of the empire was described by Sozomen as ready to do anything for the sake of Christianity.[21] Pulcheria and Theodosius were victorious in their invasion of Persia, and according to historians Theodosius had credited his sisters vow of virginity as the reason for victory.

Pulcheria had inspired war against Persia when Persian King Yazdegerd I executed a Christian bishop who destroyed an Zoroastrian altar.[21] Under the influence of Pulcheria, Theodosius sent troops into battle against Persia, the fanaticism over the war by the people of the empire was described by Sozomen as ready to do anything for the sake of Christianity.[21] Pulcheria and Theodosius were victorious in their invasion of Persia, and according to historians Theodosius had credited his sisters vow of virginity as the reason for victory. Surviving letters identify the source of that victory through the vows of his sisters. In his view, when Pulcheria devoted her virginity to God and imposed the same vow on her sisters, she secured Gods favor, causing every threat and war raised against her brother to disperse spontaneously.[22] Theodosius had made his sisters virginity a tool of war propaganda, and because of her vow to be faithful only to God the hand of God would help Roman troops in battle against Persia. Pulcherias power would become even greater after the death of her brother Theodosius II.Aelia Pulcheria (January 19, 398 or 399 – 453) was the daughter of Eastern Roman Emperor Arcadius and Empress Aelia Eudoxia. She was the second child born to Arcadius and Eudoxia. Her older sister was Flaccilla, who was born in 397 but is assumed to have died young. Her younger siblings were Arcadia, born in 400, Theodosius II, the future emperor, and Marina, both born in 401.[1] When her father Arcadius died in 408, her brother Theodosius II was made Emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire, at seven years old. On July 4, 414 a fifteen-year-old Pulcheria proclaimed herself regent over her brother, then thirteen years of age, and made herself Augusta and Empress of the Eastern Roman Empire. According to the ancient historian Sozomen, in his Ecclesiastical History, Pulcheria took a vow of virginity when she became Augusta, and her sisters followed suit. Theodosius II died on July 26, 450, and Pulcheria soon married Marcian on November 25, 450. Marcian and Pulcheria were proclaimed Emperor and Empress of the Eastern Roman Empire. Three years later, in July 453, Pulcheria died; she was later made a saint by the Church.[2] Pulcheria is known to have held a significant amount of power in her brothers reign as emperor. Pulcheria was also of great influence over the church and theological practices of this time. She had influence over anti-pagan policies, church building projects, and the debate over the Marian title Theotokos (Birth-giver to God).Contents  [hide] 1 Biography1.1 Early life1.2 The Emperors Guardian1.3 Vow of virginity1.4 Augusta1.5 Empress1.5.1 Church conflict1.6 Death2 Relationship with Aelia Eudocia3 Influence over the church4 See also5 Notes6 ReferencesBiography[edit]Early life[edit]Pulcheria was born into the royal House of Theodosius, a dynasty of the later Roman empire, ruling in Constantinople. Her father was Arcadius, and her mother was Aelia Eudoxia. Like Pulcheria, her mother was also powerful and of great influence over the church, however not in the same way Pulcheria was. Arcadius reign was marked by the conflict between his wife and the Bishop of Constantinople,“Although his reign (Arcadius) was short, it is remembered in part for the controversial conflicts Eudoxia encountered with John Chrysostom, bishop of Constantinople from 398 to 404.[3] According to the ancient historian Sozomen, in his Ecclesiastical History, Sozomen claims that much of the rivalry was based on an ornate statue made in the honor of Eudoxia which Chrysostom condemned, “The silver statue of the empress...was placed upon a column of porphyry; and the event was celebrated by loud acclamations, dancing, games, and other manifestations of public rejoicing...John declared that these proceedings reflected dishonor on the church.”[4] According to Sozomen, John had also condemned the empress for her grandiose style of ruling over the empire and condemned her in the church, this of course enraged the empress and John was immediately disposed of. Later in life, Pulcheria would bring back the remains of John Chrysostom and make them into relics for the church, in gratitude for his pious life.[5] Eudoxia died in 404 and the emperor Arcadius died in 408. The emperor left behind four young children, including a seven-year-old Theodosius II. Theodosius was made emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire in 408, immediately after his father died. Two praetorian prefects were selected as regents over Theodosius, one being Anthemius and the other, Antiochus; both took over as regent. Eventually Pulcheria herself would take over as regent for her brother.The Emperors Guardian[edit]Once Pulcheria came of age, at fifteen, she felt, like her brother, that her family had no need for Antiochus any longer; her brother dismissed him of his duties. She then became her own brother’s regent: “In 412 Pulcheria quarreled with Antiochus, who like Anthemius had served the dynasty faithfully for a number of years, and induced her brother to dismiss him from the duties of praepositus. She then took personal charge of the imperial family, directing its affairs with such authority that she became known in society at large as the emperor’s guardian.”[6] Immediately when Pulcheria took authority over the imperial palace, the palace took on a much more monastic tone compared to that of her mother’s palace. Sozomen describes Pulcheria’s and her sisters pious ways in his Ecclesiastical History: “They all pursue the same mode of life; they are sedulous in their attendance in the house of prayer, and evince great charity towards strangers and the poor...and pass their days and their nights together in singing the praises of God.”[7] Rituals within the imperial palace also included chanting and reciting passages in the scripture, and fasting twice a week.[6] The sisters were known to have given up luxurious jewelry and apparel worn by most women of the imperial court of the past. Pulcheria also took on the role of providing all the training necessary for Theodosius to become a successful emperor, once he came of age. Although the empire was technically to be ruled by Theodosius II when he would come of age, his older sister Pulcheria exercised such profound influence over him all his life that she must be considered the co-regent of the empire until her death in 453. In fact it can be said without exaggeration that Pulcheria gave the identity to her brothers reign.[8] Pulcherias training of Theodosius included, ...how an Emperor must walk, and ride his horse, alone or in procession; how he should sit upon his throne: how to wear his Imperial armor and robes; and how to speak with dignity. By no means must he yield to loud laughter...[9] Not only did Pulcheria train her brother on the duties and customs of becoming an Emperor, but she also made sure Theodosius was trained to be a pious Christian leader. Once Theodosius came of age to rule as sole Emperor, according to many historians, the teachings of his sister had been ignored. “He was by nature kind, affable, easily led...Not only was he foolishly kind; he was careless, and often he was to neglect his duty in the administration of his Empire.”[10] This lack of power that Theodosius exemplified led to Pulcheria taking on a much larger role of authority and influence in the Empire.Vow of virginity[edit]At the same time Pulcheria proclaimed herself as guardian over her brother she also took a vow of virginity, and her sisters did as well. Pulcheria’s reason for a vow of virginity may have been her deeply religious virtue as recorded by Sozomen: “She devoted her virginity to God, and instructed her sisters to do likewise. To avoid cause of scandal and opportunities for intrigue, she permitted no man to enter her palace. In confirmation of her resolution she took God, the priests, and all the subjects of the Roman empire as witnesses...”[11] Another contemporary of Pulcheria had also described her deep piety. In a letter from Pope Leo I to Pulcheria, he compliments her on her deeply religious ways: In it you clearly show how much you love the Catholic faith and how much you despise the errors of heretics.[12] Along with being deeply pious, it is possible that Pulcheria may have had other motives to take a vow of virginity. According to ancient historians Sozomen, Socrates, and Theodoret, Pulcheria had a deep dislike for Anthemius, the former guardian of Theodosius;[13] the reasons may have been his distaste for her immense power within the empire and her unwillingness to allow Anthemius to gain power amongst the imperial court. A more recent historian, Kenneth Holum, states that Anthemius had tried to make family ties between himself and the imperial family: “Married long since and many years Pulcheria’s senior, Anthemis naturally proposed a descendent or close relative, a grandson perhaps...born a few years earlier than Pulcheria and an excellent prospect for her hand”[14] Pulcheria had found herself in a position where she would have to give her power up to her potential husband, for once a woman in the imperial court married her power was to be relinquished to her husband. In order for Pulcheria to keep her power within the imperial court she took a vow of virginity to ensure that another man could not share her power.Augusta[edit]In 414 the Roman senate made Pulcheria Augusta. During her time as Augusta, Pulcheria held a great deal of power in politics and although she was a woman was treated equally among other men of power. In the senate of Constantinople lay a bust in her honor along with the other Augusti.[15] Many important events occurred during her time as Augusta and her brothers reign as emperor; however, Pulcheria’s influence was mostly in the church. Pulcheria and her brother were known to have harbored anti Jewish sentiment, and both had started to enact laws against Jewish worship in the city of Constantinople. Before the reign of Theodosius II, synagogues were seen as private property and were protected by the imperial government. In Theodosius’s reign he enacted a law that forbade the construction of synagogues, and demanded the destruction of synagogues as well. Pulcheria and Theodosius also ordered that a group of Jews be killed after strife amongst Christians emerged in Palestine.[16] It was well known that Pulcheria had little respect for Jewish people, stemmed by her disapproval of Nestorian theological practices; Kenneth Holum writes “Pulcheria had long nursed a special hatred for Jews, and the Nestorian heresy, which appeared to contemporaries to be of Jewish origin; no doubt had served to confirm that hatred.”[17] Although Pulcheria was known to have strong feelings against pagans and Jews alike, she was known for her philanthropic spirit as well. She had built many churches in and around the city of Constantinople, she had also built many buildings for the poor in the city Sozomen writes that it would take too much time to describe all the churches Pulcheria built, as well as hospitals and inns for the poor.[18] Pulcherias building projects were so vast in Constantinople that a whole district was named in her honor called the Pulcherianai, Some of these establishments were extensive enough to give the names of their proprietors to entire quarters of the city such as the Marina quarter in the second region and the Pulcherianai in the eleventh.[19] As well as contributing to the city with new churches and districts, Pulcheria contributed significantly to the church by bringing back bishops or remains of bishops who had once been dismissed as relics to the church.

She had built many churches in and around the city of Constantinople, she had also built many buildings for the poor in the city Sozomen writes that it would take too much time to describe all the churches Pulcheria built, as well as hospitals and inns for the poor.[18] Pulcherias building projects were so vast in Constantinople that a whole district was named in her honor called the Pulcherianai, Some of these establishments were extensive enough to give the names of their proprietors to entire quarters of the city such as the Marina quarter in the second region and the Pulcherianai in the eleventh.[19] As well as contributing to the city with new churches and districts, Pulcheria contributed significantly to the church by bringing back bishops or remains of bishops who had once been dismissed as relics to the church. Pope Leo I describes Pulcherias contributions to the church in a letter to her, ...the entire Roman Church is most grateful to you for all the works of your faith, whether having assisted envoys in every way with devoted affection and for having brought back the Catholic bishops who were ejected from their churches by an unjust sentence, or for having brought back with fitting honor to the church he governed so well the remains of Flavian of holy memory, an innocent and Catholic bishop.[20] Pulcherias time as Augusta was also marked with war and ongoing conflict with Persia. Pulcheria had inspired war against Persia when Persian King Yazdegerd I executed a Christian bishop who destroyed an Zoroastrian altar.[21] Under the influence of Pulcheria, Theodosius sent troops into battle against Persia, the fanaticism over the war by the people of the empire was described by Sozomen as ready to do anything for the sake of Christianity.[21] Pulcheria and Theodosius were victorious in their invasion of Persia, and according to historians Theodosius had credited his sisters vow of virginity as the reason for victory. Surviving letters identify the source of that victory through the vows of his sisters. In his view, when Pulcheria devoted her virginity to God and imposed the same vow on her sisters, she secured Gods favor, causing every threat and war raised against her brother to disperse spontaneously.[22] Theodosius had made his sisters virginity a tool of war propaganda, and because of her vow to be faithful only to God the hand of God would help Roman troops in battle against Persia. Pulcherias power would become even greater after the death of her brother Theodosius II.Aelia Pulcheria (January 19, 398 or 399 – 453) was the daughter of Eastern Roman Emperor Arcadius and Empress Aelia Eudoxia. She was the second child born to Arcadius and Eudoxia. Her older sister was Flaccilla, who was born in 397 but is assumed to have died young. Her younger siblings were Arcadia, born in 400, Theodosius II, the future emperor, and Marina, both born in 401.[1] When her father Arcadius died in 408, her brother Theodosius II was made Emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire, at seven years old. On July 4, 414 a fifteen-year-old Pulcheria proclaimed herself regent over her brother, then thirteen years of age, and made herself Augusta and Empress of the Eastern Roman Empire. According to the ancient historian Sozomen, in his Ecclesiastical History, Pulcheria took a vow of virginity when she became Augusta, and her sisters followed suit. Theodosius II died on July 26, 450, and Pulcheria soon married Marcian on November 25, 450. Marcian and Pulcheria were proclaimed Emperor and Empress of the Eastern Roman Empire. Three years later, in July 453, Pulcheria died; she was later made a saint by the Church.[2] Pulcheria is known to have held a significant amount of power in her brothers reign as emperor. Pulcheria was also of great influence over the church and theological practices of this time. She had influence over anti-pagan policies, church building projects, and the debate over the Marian title Theotokos (Birth-giver to God).Contents  [hide] 1 Biography1.1 Early life1.2 The Emperors Guardian1.3 Vow of virginity1.4 Augusta1.5 Empress1.5.1 Church conflict1.6 Death2 Relationship with Aelia Eudocia3 Influence over the church4 See also5 Notes6 ReferencesBiography[edit]Early life[edit]Pulcheria was born into the royal House of Theodosius, a dynasty of the later Roman empire, ruling in Constantinople. Her father was Arcadius, and her mother was Aelia Eudoxia. Like Pulcheria, her mother was also powerful and of great influence over the church, however not in the same way Pulcheria was. Arcadius reign was marked by the conflict between his wife and the Bishop of Constantinople,“Although his reign (Arcadius) was short, it is remembered in part for the controversial conflicts Eudoxia encountered with John Chrysostom, bishop of Constantinople from 398 to 404.[3] According to the ancient historian Sozomen, in his Ecclesiastical History, Sozomen claims that much of the rivalry was based on an ornate statue made in the honor of Eudoxia which Chrysostom condemned, “The silver statue of the empress...was placed upon a column of porphyry; and the event was celebrated by loud acclamations, dancing, games, and other manifestations of public rejoicing...John declared that these proceedings reflected dishonor on the church.”[4] According to Sozomen, John had also condemned the empress for her grandiose style of ruling over the empire and condemned her in the church, this of course enraged the empress and John was immediately disposed of. Later in life, Pulcheria would bring back the remains of John Chrysostom and make them into relics for the church, in gratitude for his pious life.[5] Eudoxia died in 404 and the emperor Arcadius died in 408. The emperor left behind four young children, including a seven-year-old Theodosius II. Theodosius was made emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire in 408, immediately after his father died. Two praetorian prefects were selected as regents over Theodosius, one being Anthemius and the other, Antiochus; both took over as regent. Eventually Pulcheria herself would take over as regent for her brother.The Emperors Guardian[edit]Once Pulcheria came of age, at fifteen, she felt, like her brother, that her family had no need for Antiochus any longer; her brother dismissed him of his duties. She then became her own brother’s regent: “In 412 Pulcheria quarreled with Antiochus, who like Anthemius had served the dynasty faithfully for a number of years, and induced her brother to dismiss him from the duties of praepositus. She then took personal charge of the imperial family, directing its affairs with such authority that she became known in society at large as the emperor’s guardian.”[6] Immediately when Pulcheria took authority over the imperial palace, the palace took on a much more monastic tone compared to that of her mother’s palace. Sozomen describes Pulcheria’s and her sisters pious ways in his Ecclesiastical History: “They all pursue the same mode of life; they are sedulous in their attendance in the house of prayer, and evince great charity towards strangers and the poor...and pass their days and their nights together in singing the praises of God.”[7] Rituals within the imperial palace also included chanting and reciting passages in the scripture, and fasting twice a week.[6] The sisters were known to have given up luxurious jewelry and apparel worn by most women of the imperial court of the past. Pulcheria also took on the role of providing all the training necessary for Theodosius to become a successful emperor, once he came of age. Although the empire was technically to be ruled by Theodosius II when he would come of age, his older sister Pulcheria exercised such profound influence over him all his life that she must be considered the co-regent of the empire until her death in 453. In fact it can be said without exaggeration that Pulcheria gave the identity to her brothers reign.[8] Pulcherias training of Theodosius included, ...how an Emperor must walk, and ride his horse, alone or in procession; how he should sit upon his throne: how to wear his Imperial armor and robes; and how to speak with dignity. By no means must he yield to loud laughter...[9] Not only did Pulcheria train her brother on the duties and customs of becoming an Emperor, but she also made sure Theodosius was trained to be a pious Christian leader. Once Theodosius came of age to rule as sole Emperor, according to many historians, the teachings of his sister had been ignored. “He was by nature kind, affable, easily led...Not only was he foolishly kind; he was careless, and often he was to neglect his duty in the administration of his Empire.”[10] This lack of power that Theodosius exemplified led to Pulcheria taking on a much larger role of authority and influence in the Empire.Vow of virginity[edit]At the same time Pulcheria proclaimed herself as guardian over her brother she also took a vow of virginity, and her sisters did as well. Pulcheria’s reason for a vow of virginity may have been her deeply religious virtue as recorded by Sozomen: “She devoted her virginity to God, and instructed her sisters to do likewise. To avoid cause of scandal and opportunities for intrigue, she permitted no man to enter her palace. In confirmation of her resolution she took God, the priests, and all the subjects of the Roman empire as witnesses...”[11] Another contemporary of Pulcheria had also described her deep piety. In a letter from Pope Leo I to Pulcheria, he compliments her on her deeply religious ways: In it you clearly show how much you love the Catholic faith and how much you despise the errors of heretics.[12] Along with being deeply pious, it is possible that Pulcheria may have had other motives to take a vow of virginity. According to ancient historians Sozomen, Socrates, and Theodoret, Pulcheria had a deep dislike for Anthemius, the former guardian of Theodosius;[13] the reasons may have been his distaste for her immense power within the empire and her unwillingness to allow Anthemius to gain power amongst the imperial court. A more recent historian, Kenneth Holum, states that Anthemius had tried to make family ties between himself and the imperial family: “Married long since and many years Pulcheria’s senior, Anthemis naturally proposed a descendent or close relative, a grandson perhaps...born a few years earlier than Pulcheria and an excellent prospect for her hand”[14] Pulcheria had found herself in a position where she would have to give her power up to her potential husband, for once a woman in the imperial court married her power was to be relinquished to her husband. In order for Pulcheria to keep her power within the imperial court she took a vow of virginity to ensure that another man could not share her power.Augusta[edit]In 414 the Roman senate made Pulcheria Augusta. During her time as Augusta, Pulcheria held a great deal of power in politics and although she was a woman was treated equally among other men of power. In the senate of Constantinople lay a bust in her honor along with the other Augusti.[15] Many important events occurred during her time as Augusta and her brothers reign as emperor; however, Pulcheria’s influence was mostly in the church. Pulcheria and her brother were known to have harbored anti Jewish sentiment, and both had started to enact laws against Jewish worship in the city of Constantinople. Before the reign of Theodosius II, synagogues were seen as private property and were protected by the imperial government. In Theodosius’s reign he enacted a law that forbade the construction of synagogues, and demanded the destruction of synagogues as well.

Pulcheria and Theodosius also ordered that a group of Jews be killed after strife amongst Christians emerged in Palestine.[16] It was well known that Pulcheria had little respect for Jewish people, stemmed by her disapproval of Nestorian theological practices; Kenneth Holum writes “Pulcheria had long nursed a special hatred for Jews, and the Nestorian heresy, which appeared to contemporaries to be of Jewish origin; no doubt had served to confirm that hatred.”[17] Although Pulcheria was known to have strong feelings against pagans and Jews alike, she was known for her philanthropic spirit as well. She had built many churches in and around the city of Constantinople, she had also built many buildings for the poor in the city Sozomen writes that it would take too much time to describe all the churches Pulcheria built, as well as hospitals and inns for the poor.[18] Pulcherias building projects were so vast in Constantinople that a whole district was named in her honor called the Pulcherianai, Some of these establishments were extensive enough to give the names of their proprietors to entire quarters of the city such as the Marina quarter in the second region and the Pulcherianai in the eleventh.[19] As well as contributing to the city with new churches and districts, Pulcheria contributed significantly to the church by bringing back bishops or remains of bishops who had once been dismissed as relics to the church. Pope Leo I describes Pulcherias contributions to the church in a letter to her, ...the entire Roman Church is most grateful to you for all the works of your faith, whether having assisted envoys in every way with devoted affection and for having brought back the Catholic bishops who were ejected from their churches by an unjust sentence, or for having brought back with fitting honor to the church he governed so well the remains of Flavian of holy memory, an innocent and Catholic bishop.[20] Pulcherias time as Augusta was also marked with war and ongoing conflict with Persia. Pulcheria had inspired war against Persia when Persian King Yazdegerd I executed a Christian bishop who destroyed an Zoroastrian altar.[21] Under the influence of Pulcheria, Theodosius sent troops into battle against Persia, the fanaticism over the war by the people of the empire was described by Sozomen as ready to do anything for the sake of Christianity.[21] Pulcheria and Theodosius were victorious in their invasion of Persia, and according to historians Theodosius had credited his sisters vow of virginity as the reason for victory. Surviving letters identify the source of that victory through the vows of his sisters. In his view, when Pulcheria devoted her virginity to God and imposed the same vow on her sisters, she secured Gods favor, causing every threat and war raised against her brother to disperse spontaneously.[22] Theodosius had made his sisters virginity a tool of war propaganda, and because of her vow to be faithful only to God the hand of God would help Roman troops in battle against Persia. Pulcherias power would become even greater after the death of her brother Theodosius II.Aelia Pulcheria (January 19, 398 or 399 – 453) was the daughter of Eastern Roman Emperor Arcadius and Empress Aelia Eudoxia. She was the second child born to Arcadius and Eudoxia. Her older sister was Flaccilla, who was born in 397 but is assumed to have died young. Her younger siblings were Arcadia, born in 400, Theodosius II, the future emperor, and Marina, both born in 401.[1] When her father Arcadius died in 408, her brother Theodosius II was made Emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire, at seven years old. On July 4, 414 a fifteen-year-old Pulcheria proclaimed herself regent over her brother, then thirteen years of age, and made herself Augusta and Empress of the Eastern Roman Empire. According to the ancient historian Sozomen, in his Ecclesiastical History, Pulcheria took a vow of virginity when she became Augusta, and her sisters followed suit. Theodosius II died on July 26, 450, and Pulcheria soon married Marcian on November 25, 450. Marcian and Pulcheria were proclaimed Emperor and Empress of the Eastern Roman Empire. Three years later, in July 453, Pulcheria died; she was later made a saint by the Church.[2] Pulcheria is known to have held a significant amount of power in her brothers reign as emperor. Pulcheria was also of great influence over the church and theological practices of this time. She had influence over anti-pagan policies, church building projects, and the debate over the Marian title Theotokos (Birth-giver to God).Contents  [hide] 1 Biography1.1 Early life1.2 The Emperors Guardian1.3 Vow of virginity1.4 Augusta1.5 Empress1.5.1 Church conflict1.6 Death2 Relationship with Aelia Eudocia3 Influence over the church4 See also5 Notes6 ReferencesBiography[edit]Early life[edit]Pulcheria was born into the royal House of Theodosius, a dynasty of the later Roman empire, ruling in Constantinople. Her father was Arcadius, and her mother was Aelia Eudoxia. Like Pulcheria, her mother was also powerful and of great influence over the church, however not in the same way Pulcheria was. Arcadius reign was marked by the conflict between his wife and the Bishop of Constantinople,“Although his reign (Arcadius) was short, it is remembered in part for the controversial conflicts Eudoxia encountered with John Chrysostom, bishop of Constantinople from 398 to 404.[3] According to the ancient historian Sozomen, in his Ecclesiastical History, Sozomen claims that much of the rivalry was based on an ornate statue made in the honor of Eudoxia which Chrysostom condemned, “The silver statue of the empress...was placed upon a column of porphyry; and the event was celebrated by loud acclamations, dancing, games, and other manifestations of public rejoicing...John declared that these proceedings reflected dishonor on the church.”[4] According to Sozomen, John had also condemned the empress for her grandiose style of ruling over the empire and condemned her in the church, this of course enraged the empress and John was immediately disposed of. Later in life, Pulcheria would bring back the remains of John Chrysostom and make them into relics for the church, in gratitude for his pious life.[5] Eudoxia died in 404 and the emperor Arcadius died in 408. The emperor left behind four young children, including a seven-year-old Theodosius II. Theodosius was made emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire in 408, immediately after his father died. Two praetorian prefects were selected as regents over Theodosius, one being Anthemius and the other, Antiochus; both took over as regent. Eventually Pulcheria herself would take over as regent for her brother.The Emperors Guardian[edit]Once Pulcheria came of age, at fifteen, she felt, like her brother, that her family had no need for Antiochus any longer; her brother dismissed him of his duties. She then became her own brother’s regent: “In 412 Pulcheria quarreled with Antiochus, who like Anthemius had served the dynasty faithfully for a number of years, and induced her brother to dismiss him from the duties of praepositus. She then took personal charge of the imperial family, directing its affairs with such authority that she became known in society at large as the emperor’s guardian.”[6] Immediately when Pulcheria took authority over the imperial palace, the palace took on a much more monastic tone compared to that of her mother’s palace. Sozomen describes Pulcheria’s and her sisters pious ways in his Ecclesiastical History: “They all pursue the same mode of life; they are sedulous in their attendance in the house of prayer, and evince great charity towards strangers and the poor...and pass their days and their nights together in singing the praises of God.”[7] Rituals within the imperial palace also included chanting and reciting passages in the scripture, and fasting twice a week.[6] The sisters were known to have given up luxurious jewelry and apparel worn by most women of the imperial court of the past. Pulcheria also took on the role of providing all the training necessary for Theodosius to become a successful emperor, once he came of age. Although the empire was technically to be ruled by Theodosius II when he would come of age, his older sister Pulcheria exercised such profound influence over him all his life that she must be considered the co-regent of the empire until her death in 453. In fact it can be said without exaggeration that Pulcheria gave the identity to her brothers reign.[8] Pulcherias training of Theodosius included, ...how an Emperor must walk, and ride his horse, alone or in procession; how he should sit upon his throne: how to wear his Imperial armor and robes; and how to speak with dignity. By no means must he yield to loud laughter...[9] Not only did Pulcheria train her brother on the duties and customs of becoming an Emperor, but she also made sure Theodosius was trained to be a pious Christian leader. Once Theodosius came of age to rule as sole Emperor, according to many historians, the teachings of his sister had been ignored. “He was by nature kind, affable, easily led...Not only was he foolishly kind; he was careless, and often he was to neglect his duty in the administration of his Empire.”[10] This lack of power that Theodosius exemplified led to Pulcheria taking on a much larger role of authority and influence in the Empire.Vow of virginity[edit]At the same time Pulcheria proclaimed herself as guardian over her brother she also took a vow of virginity, and her sisters did as well. Pulcheria’s reason for a vow of virginity may have been her deeply religious virtue as recorded by Sozomen: “She devoted her virginity to God, and instructed her sisters to do likewise. To avoid cause of scandal and opportunities for intrigue, she permitted no man to enter her palace. In confirmation of her resolution she took God, the priests, and all the subjects of the Roman empire as witnesses...”[11] Another contemporary of Pulcheria had also described her deep piety. In a letter from Pope Leo I to Pulcheria, he compliments her on her deeply religious ways: In it you clearly show how much you love the Catholic faith and how much you despise the errors of heretics.[12] Along with being deeply pious, it is possible that Pulcheria may have had other motives to take a vow of virginity. According to ancient historians Sozomen, Socrates, and Theodoret, Pulcheria had a deep dislike for Anthemius, the former guardian of Theodosius;[13] the reasons may have been his distaste for her immense power within the empire and her unwillingness to allow Anthemius to gain power amongst the imperial court. A more recent historian, Kenneth Holum, states that Anthemius had tried to make family ties between himself and the imperial family: “Married long since and many years Pulcheria’s senior, Anthemis naturally proposed a descendent or close relative, a grandson perhaps...born a few years earlier than Pulcheria and an excellent prospect for her hand”[14] Pulcheria had found herself in a position where she would have to give her power up to her potential husband, for once a woman in the imperial court married her power was to be relinquished to her husband. In order for Pulcheria to keep her power within the imperial court she took a vow of virginity to ensure that another man could not share her power.Augusta[edit]In 414 the Roman senate made Pulcheria Augusta. During her time as Augusta, Pulcheria held a great deal of power in politics and although she was a woman was treated equally among other men of power. In the senate of Constantinople lay a bust in her honor along with the other Augusti.[15] Many important events occurred during her time as Augusta and her brothers reign as emperor; however, Pulcheria’s influence was mostly in the church. Pulcheria and her brother were known to have harbored anti Jewish sentiment, and both had started to enact laws against Jewish worship in the city of Constantinople. Before the reign of Theodosius II, synagogues were seen as private property and were protected by the imperial government. In Theodosius’s reign he enacted a law that forbade the construction of synagogues, and demanded the destruction of synagogues as well.

In Theodosius’s reign he enacted a law that forbade the construction of synagogues, and demanded the destruction of synagogues as well. Pulcheria and Theodosius also ordered that a group of Jews be killed after strife amongst Christians emerged in Palestine.[16] It was well known that Pulcheria had little respect for Jewish people, stemmed by her disapproval of Nestorian theological practices; Kenneth Holum writes “Pulcheria had long nursed a special hatred for Jews, and the Nestorian heresy, which appeared to contemporaries to be of Jewish origin; no doubt had served to confirm that hatred.”[17] Although Pulcheria was known to have strong feelings against pagans and Jews alike, she was known for her philanthropic spirit as well. She had built many churches in and around the city of Constantinople, she had also built many buildings for the poor in the city Sozomen writes that it would take too much time to describe all the churches Pulcheria built, as well as hospitals and inns for the poor.[18] Pulcherias building projects were so vast in Constantinople that a whole district was named in her honor called the Pulcherianai, Some of these establishments were extensive enough to give the names of their proprietors to entire quarters of the city such as the Marina quarter in the second region and the Pulcherianai in the eleventh.[19] As well as contributing to the city with new churches and districts, Pulcheria contributed significantly to the church by bringing back bishops or remains of bishops who had once been dismissed as relics to the church. Pope Leo I describes Pulcherias contributions to the church in a letter to her, ...the entire Roman Church is most grateful to you for all the works of your faith, whether having assisted envoys in every way with devoted affection and for having brought back the Catholic bishops who were ejected from their churches by an unjust sentence, or for having brought back with fitting honor to the church he governed so well the remains of Flavian of holy memory, an innocent and Catholic bishop.[20] Pulcherias time as Augusta was also marked with war and ongoing conflict with Persia. Pulcheria had inspired war against Persia when Persian King Yazdegerd I executed a Christian bishop who destroyed an Zoroastrian altar.[21] Under the influence of Pulcheria, Theodosius sent troops into battle against Persia, the fanaticism over the war by the people of the empire was described by Sozomen as ready to do anything for the sake of Christianity.[21] Pulcheria and Theodosius were victorious in their invasion of Persia, and according to historians Theodosius had credited his sisters vow of virginity as the reason for victory. Surviving letters identify the source of that victory through the vows of his sisters. In his view, when Pulcheria devoted her virginity to God and imposed the same vow on her sisters, she secured Gods favor, causing every threat and war raised against her brother to disperse spontaneously.[22] Theodosius had made his sisters virginity a tool of war propaganda, and because of her vow to be faithful only to God the hand of God would help Roman troops in battle against Persia. Pulcherias power would become even greater after the death of her brother Theodosius II.Aelia Pulcheria (January 19, 398 or 399 – 453) was the daughter of Eastern Roman Emperor Arcadius and Empress Aelia Eudoxia. She was the second child born to Arcadius and Eudoxia. Her older sister was Flaccilla, who was born in 397 but is assumed to have died young. Her younger siblings were Arcadia, born in 400, Theodosius II, the future emperor, and Marina, both born in 401.[1] When her father Arcadius died in 408, her brother Theodosius II was made Emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire, at seven years old. On July 4, 414 a fifteen-year-old Pulcheria proclaimed herself regent over her brother, then thirteen years of age, and made herself Augusta and Empress of the Eastern Roman Empire. According to the ancient historian Sozomen, in his Ecclesiastical History, Pulcheria took a vow of virginity when she became Augusta, and her sisters followed suit. Theodosius II died on July 26, 450, and Pulcheria soon married Marcian on November 25, 450. Marcian and Pulcheria were proclaimed Emperor and Empress of the Eastern Roman Empire. Three years later, in July 453, Pulcheria died; she was later made a saint by the Church.[2] Pulcheria is known to have held a significant amount of power in her brothers reign as emperor. Pulcheria was also of great influence over the church and theological practices of this time. She had influence over anti-pagan policies, church building projects, and the debate over the Marian title Theotokos (Birth-giver to God).Contents  [hide] 1 Biography1.1 Early life1.2 The Emperors Guardian1.3 Vow of virginity1.4 Augusta1.5 Empress1.5.1 Church conflict1.6 Death2 Relationship with Aelia Eudocia3 Influence over the church4 See also5 Notes6 ReferencesBiography[edit]Early life[edit]Pulcheria was born into the royal House of Theodosius, a dynasty of the later Roman empire, ruling in Constantinople. Her father was Arcadius, and her mother was Aelia Eudoxia. Like Pulcheria, her mother was also powerful and of great influence over the church, however not in the same way Pulcheria was. Arcadius reign was marked by the conflict between his wife and the Bishop of Constantinople,“Although his reign (Arcadius) was short, it is remembered in part for the controversial conflicts Eudoxia encountered with John Chrysostom, bishop of Constantinople from 398 to 404.[3] According to the ancient historian Sozomen, in his Ecclesiastical History, Sozomen claims that much of the rivalry was based on an ornate statue made in the honor of Eudoxia which Chrysostom condemned, “The silver statue of the empress...was placed upon a column of porphyry; and the event was celebrated by loud acclamations, dancing, games, and other manifestations of public rejoicing...John declared that these proceedings reflected dishonor on the church.”[4] According to Sozomen, John had also condemned the empress for her grandiose style of ruling over the empire and condemned her in the church, this of course enraged the empress and John was immediately disposed of. Later in life, Pulcheria would bring back the remains of John Chrysostom and make them into relics for the church, in gratitude for his pious life.[5] Eudoxia died in 404 and the emperor Arcadius died in 408. The emperor left behind four young children, including a seven-year-old Theodosius II. Theodosius was made emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire in 408, immediately after his father died. Two praetorian prefects were selected as regents over Theodosius, one being Anthemius and the other, Antiochus; both took over as regent. Eventually Pulcheria herself would take over as regent for her brother.The Emperors Guardian[edit]Once Pulcheria came of age, at fifteen, she felt, like her brother, that her family had no need for Antiochus any longer; her brother dismissed him of his duties. She then became her own brother’s regent: “In 412 Pulcheria quarreled with Antiochus, who like Anthemius had served the dynasty faithfully for a number of years, and induced her brother to dismiss him from the duties of praepositus. She then took personal charge of the imperial family, directing its affairs with such authority that she became known in society at large as the emperor’s guardian.”[6] Immediately when Pulcheria took authority over the imperial palace, the palace took on a much more monastic tone compared to that of her mother’s palace. Sozomen describes Pulcheria’s and her sisters pious ways in his Ecclesiastical History: “They all pursue the same mode of life; they are sedulous in their attendance in the house of prayer, and evince great charity towards strangers and the poor...and pass their days and their nights together in singing the praises of God.”[7] Rituals within the imperial palace also included chanting and reciting passages in the scripture, and fasting twice a week.[6] The sisters were known to have given up luxurious jewelry and apparel worn by most women of the imperial court of the past. Pulcheria also took on the role of providing all the training necessary for Theodosius to become a successful emperor, once he came of age. Although the empire was technically to be ruled by Theodosius II when he would come of age, his older sister Pulcheria exercised such profound influence over him all his life that she must be considered the co-regent of the empire until her death in 453. In fact it can be said without exaggeration that Pulcheria gave the identity to her brothers reign.[8] Pulcherias training of Theodosius included, ...how an Emperor must walk, and ride his horse, alone or in procession; how he should sit upon his throne: how to wear his Imperial armor and robes; and how to speak with dignity. By no means must he yield to loud laughter...[9] Not only did Pulcheria train her brother on the duties and customs of becoming an Emperor, but she also made sure Theodosius was trained to be a pious Christian leader. Once Theodosius came of age to rule as sole Emperor, according to many historians, the teachings of his sister had been ignored. “He was by nature kind, affable, easily led...Not only was he foolishly kind; he was careless, and often he was to neglect his duty in the administration of his Empire.”[10] This lack of power that Theodosius exemplified led to Pulcheria taking on a much larger role of authority and influence in the Empire.Vow of virginity[edit]At the same time Pulcheria proclaimed herself as guardian over her brother she also took a vow of virginity, and her sisters did as well. Pulcheria’s reason for a vow of virginity may have been her deeply religious virtue as recorded by Sozomen: “She devoted her virginity to God, and instructed her sisters to do likewise. To avoid cause of scandal and opportunities for intrigue, she permitted no man to enter her palace. In confirmation of her resolution she took God, the priests, and all the subjects of the Roman empire as witnesses...”[11] Another contemporary of Pulcheria had also described her deep piety. In a letter from Pope Leo I to Pulcheria, he compliments her on her deeply religious ways: In it you clearly show how much you love the Catholic faith and how much you despise the errors of heretics.[12] Along with being deeply pious, it is possible that Pulcheria may have had other motives to take a vow of virginity. According to ancient historians Sozomen, Socrates, and Theodoret, Pulcheria had a deep dislike for Anthemius, the former guardian of Theodosius;[13] the reasons may have been his distaste for her immense power within the empire and her unwillingness to allow Anthemius to gain power amongst the imperial court. A more recent historian, Kenneth Holum, states that Anthemius had tried to make family ties between himself and the imperial family: “Married long since and many years Pulcheria’s senior, Anthemis naturally proposed a descendent or close relative, a grandson perhaps...born a few years earlier than Pulcheria and an excellent prospect for her hand”[14] Pulcheria had found herself in a position where she would have to give her power up to her potential husband, for once a woman in the imperial court married her power was to be relinquished to her husband. In order for Pulcheria to keep her power within the imperial court she took a vow of virginity to ensure that another man could not share her power.Augusta[edit]In 414 the Roman senate made Pulcheria Augusta. During her time as Augusta, Pulcheria held a great deal of power in politics and although she was a woman was treated equally among other men of power. In the senate of Constantinople lay a bust in her honor along with the other Augusti.[15] Many important events occurred during her time as Augusta and her brothers reign as emperor; however, Pulcheria’s influence was mostly in the church. Pulcheria and her brother were known to have harbored anti Jewish sentiment, and both had started to enact laws against Jewish worship in the city of Constantinople. Before the reign of Theodosius II, synagogues were seen as private property and were protected by the imperial government.

Before the reign of Theodosius II, synagogues were seen as private property and were protected by the imperial government. In Theodosius’s reign he enacted a law that forbade the construction of synagogues, and demanded the destruction of synagogues as well. Pulcheria and Theodosius also ordered that a group of Jews be killed after strife amongst Christians emerged in Palestine.[16] It was well known that Pulcheria had little respect for Jewish people, stemmed by her disapproval of Nestorian theological practices; Kenneth Holum writes “Pulcheria had long nursed a special hatred for Jews, and the Nestorian heresy, which appeared to contemporaries to be of Jewish origin; no doubt had served to confirm that hatred.”[17] Although Pulcheria was known to have strong feelings against pagans and Jews alike, she was known for her philanthropic spirit as well. She had built many churches in and around the city of Constantinople, she had also built many buildings for the poor in the city Sozomen writes that it would take too much time to describe all the churches Pulcheria built, as well as hospitals and inns for the poor.[18] Pulcherias building projects were so vast in Constantinople that a whole district was named in her honor called the Pulcherianai, Some of these establishments were extensive enough to give the names of their proprietors to entire quarters of the city such as the Marina quarter in the second region and the Pulcherianai in the eleventh.[19] As well as contributing to the city with new churches and districts, Pulcheria contributed significantly to the church by bringing back bishops or remains of bishops who had once been dismissed as relics to the church. Pope Leo I describes Pulcherias contributions to the church in a letter to her, ...the entire Roman Church is most grateful to you for all the works of your faith, whether having assisted envoys in every way with devoted affection and for having brought back the Catholic bishops who were ejected from their churches by an unjust sentence, or for having brought back with fitting honor to the church he governed so well the remains of Flavian of holy memory, an innocent and Catholic bishop.[20] Pulcherias time as Augusta was also marked with war and ongoing conflict with Persia. Pulcheria had inspired war against Persia when Persian King Yazdegerd I executed a Christian bishop who destroyed an Zoroastrian altar.[21] Under the influence of Pulcheria, Theodosius sent troops into battle against Persia, the fanaticism over the war by the people of the empire was described by Sozomen as ready to do anything for the sake of Christianity.[21] Pulcheria and Theodosius were victorious in their invasion of Persia, and according to historians Theodosius had credited his sisters vow of virginity as the reason for victory. Surviving letters identify the source of that victory through the vows of his sisters. In his view, when Pulcheria devoted her virginity to God and imposed the same vow on her sisters, she secured Gods favor, causing every threat and war raised against her brother to disperse spontaneously.[22] Theodosius had made his sisters virginity a tool of war propaganda, and because of her vow to be faithful only to God the hand of God would help Roman troops in battle against Persia. Pulcherias power would become even greater after the death of her brother Theodosius II.Aelia Pulcheria (January 19, 398 or 399 – 453) was the daughter of Eastern Roman Emperor Arcadius and Empress Aelia Eudoxia. She was the second child born to Arcadius and Eudoxia. Her older sister was Flaccilla, who was born in 397 but is assumed to have died young. Her younger siblings were Arcadia, born in 400, Theodosius II, the future emperor, and Marina, both born in 401.[1] When her father Arcadius died in 408, her brother Theodosius II was made Emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire, at seven years old. On July 4, 414 a fifteen-year-old Pulcheria proclaimed herself regent over her brother, then thirteen years of age, and made herself Augusta and Empress of the Eastern Roman Empire. According to the ancient historian Sozomen, in his Ecclesiastical History, Pulcheria took a vow of virginity when she became Augusta, and her sisters followed suit. Theodosius II died on July 26, 450, and Pulcheria soon married Marcian on November 25, 450. Marcian and Pulcheria were proclaimed Emperor and Empress of the Eastern Roman Empire. Three years later, in July 453, Pulcheria died; she was later made a saint by the Church.[2] Pulcheria is known to have held a significant amount of power in her brothers reign as emperor. Pulcheria was also of great influence over the church and theological practices of this time. She had influence over anti-pagan policies, church building projects, and the debate over the Marian title Theotokos (Birth-giver to God).Contents  [hide] 1 Biography1.1 Early life1.2 The Emperors Guardian1.3 Vow of virginity1.4 Augusta1.5 Empress1.5.1 Church conflict1.6 Death2 Relationship with Aelia Eudocia3 Influence over the church4 See also5 Notes6 ReferencesBiography[edit]Early life[edit]Pulcheria was born into the royal House of Theodosius, a dynasty of the later Roman empire, ruling in Constantinople. Her father was Arcadius, and her mother was Aelia Eudoxia. Like Pulcheria, her mother was also powerful and of great influence over the church, however not in the same way Pulcheria was. Arcadius reign was marked by the conflict between his wife and the Bishop of Constantinople,“Although his reign (Arcadius) was short, it is remembered in part for the controversial conflicts Eudoxia encountered with John Chrysostom, bishop of Constantinople from 398 to 404.[3] According to the ancient historian Sozomen, in his Ecclesiastical History, Sozomen claims that much of the rivalry was based on an ornate statue made in the honor of Eudoxia which Chrysostom condemned, “The silver statue of the empress...was placed upon a column of porphyry; and the event was celebrated by loud acclamations, dancing, games, and other manifestations of public rejoicing...John declared that these proceedings reflected dishonor on the church.”[4] According to Sozomen, John had also condemned the empress for her grandiose style of ruling over the empire and condemned her in the church, this of course enraged the empress and John was immediately disposed of. Later in life, Pulcheria would bring back the remains of John Chrysostom and make them into relics for the church, in gratitude for his pious life.[5] Eudoxia died in 404 and the emperor Arcadius died in 408. The emperor left behind four young children, including a seven-year-old Theodosius II. Theodosius was made emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire in 408, immediately after his father died. Two praetorian prefects were selected as regents over Theodosius, one being Anthemius and the other, Antiochus; both took over as regent. Eventually Pulcheria herself would take over as regent for her brother.The Emperors Guardian[edit]Once Pulcheria came of age, at fifteen, she felt, like her brother, that her family had no need for Antiochus any longer; her brother dismissed him of his duties. She then became her own brother’s regent: “In 412 Pulcheria quarreled with Antiochus, who like Anthemius had served the dynasty faithfully for a number of years, and induced her brother to dismiss him from the duties of praepositus. She then took personal charge of the imperial family, directing its affairs with such authority that she became known in society at large as the emperor’s guardian.”[6] Immediately when Pulcheria took authority over the imperial palace, the palace took on a much more monastic tone compared to that of her mother’s palace. Sozomen describes Pulcheria’s and her sisters pious ways in his Ecclesiastical History: “They all pursue the same mode of life; they are sedulous in their attendance in the house of prayer, and evince great charity towards strangers and the poor...and pass their days and their nights together in singing the praises of God.”[7] Rituals within the imperial palace also included chanting and reciting passages in the scripture, and fasting twice a week.[6] The sisters were known to have given up luxurious jewelry and apparel worn by most women of the imperial court of the past. Pulcheria also took on the role of providing all the training necessary for Theodosius to become a successful emperor, once he came of age. Although the empire was technically to be ruled by Theodosius II when he would come of age, his older sister Pulcheria exercised such profound influence over him all his life that she must be considered the co-regent of the empire until her death in 453. In fact it can be said without exaggeration that Pulcheria gave the identity to her brothers reign.[8] Pulcherias training of Theodosius included, ...how an Emperor must walk, and ride his horse, alone or in procession; how he should sit upon his throne: how to wear his Imperial armor and robes; and how to speak with dignity. By no means must he yield to loud laughter...[9] Not only did Pulcheria train her brother on the duties and customs of becoming an Emperor, but she also made sure Theodosius was trained to be a pious Christian leader. Once Theodosius came of age to rule as sole Emperor, according to many historians, the teachings of his sister had been ignored. “He was by nature kind, affable, easily led...Not only was he foolishly kind; he was careless, and often he was to neglect his duty in the administration of his Empire.”[10] This lack of power that Theodosius exemplified led to Pulcheria taking on a much larger role of authority and influence in the Empire.Vow of virginity[edit]At the same time Pulcheria proclaimed herself as guardian over her brother she also took a vow of virginity, and her sisters did as well. Pulcheria’s reason for a vow of virginity may have been her deeply religious virtue as recorded by Sozomen: “She devoted her virginity to God, and instructed her sisters to do likewise. To avoid cause of scandal and opportunities for intrigue, she permitted no man to enter her palace. In confirmation of her resolution she took God, the priests, and all the subjects of the Roman empire as witnesses...”[11] Another contemporary of Pulcheria had also described her deep piety. In a letter from Pope Leo I to Pulcheria, he compliments her on her deeply religious ways: In it you clearly show how much you love the Catholic faith and how much you despise the errors of heretics.[12] Along with being deeply pious, it is possible that Pulcheria may have had other motives to take a vow of virginity. According to ancient historians Sozomen, Socrates, and Theodoret, Pulcheria had a deep dislike for Anthemius, the former guardian of Theodosius;[13] the reasons may have been his distaste for her immense power within the empire and her unwillingness to allow Anthemius to gain power amongst the imperial court. A more recent historian, Kenneth Holum, states that Anthemius had tried to make family ties between himself and the imperial family: “Married long since and many years Pulcheria’s senior, Anthemis naturally proposed a descendent or close relative, a grandson perhaps...born a few years earlier than Pulcheria and an excellent prospect for her hand”[14] Pulcheria had found herself in a position where she would have to give her power up to her potential husband, for once a woman in the imperial court married her power was to be relinquished to her husband. In order for Pulcheria to keep her power within the imperial court she took a vow of virginity to ensure that another man could not share her power.Augusta[edit]In 414 the Roman senate made Pulcheria Augusta. During her time as Augusta, Pulcheria held a great deal of power in politics and although she was a woman was treated equally among other men of power. In the senate of Constantinople lay a bust in her honor along with the other Augusti.[15] Many important events occurred during her time as Augusta and her brothers reign as emperor; however, Pulcheria’s influence was mostly in the church.

In the senate of Constantinople lay a bust in her honor along with the other Augusti.[15] Many important events occurred during her time as Augusta and her brothers reign as emperor; however, Pulcheria’s influence was mostly in the church. Pulcheria and her brother were known to have harbored anti Jewish sentiment, and both had started to enact laws against Jewish worship in the city of Constantinople. Before the reign of Theodosius II, synagogues were seen as private property and were protected by the imperial government. In Theodosius’s reign he enacted a law that forbade the construction of synagogues, and demanded the destruction of synagogues as well. Pulcheria and Theodosius also ordered that a group of Jews be killed after strife amongst Christians emerged in Palestine.[16] It was well known that Pulcheria had little respect for Jewish people, stemmed by her disapproval of Nestorian theological practices; Kenneth Holum writes “Pulcheria had long nursed a special hatred for Jews, and the Nestorian heresy, which appeared to contemporaries to be of Jewish origin; no doubt had served to confirm that hatred.”[17] Although Pulcheria was known to have strong feelings against pagans and Jews alike, she was known for her philanthropic spirit as well. She had built many churches in and around the city of Constantinople, she had also built many buildings for the poor in the city Sozomen writes that it would take too much time to describe all the churches Pulcheria built, as well as hospitals and inns for the poor.[18] Pulcherias building projects were so vast in Constantinople that a whole district was named in her honor called the Pulcherianai, Some of these establishments were extensive enough to give the names of their proprietors to entire quarters of the city such as the Marina quarter in the second region and the Pulcherianai in the eleventh.[19] As well as contributing to the city with new churches and districts, Pulcheria contributed significantly to the church by bringing back bishops or remains of bishops who had once been dismissed as relics to the church. Pope Leo I describes Pulcherias contributions to the church in a letter to her, ...the entire Roman Church is most grateful to you for all the works of your faith, whether having assisted envoys in every way with devoted affection and for having brought back the Catholic bishops who were ejected from their churches by an unjust sentence, or for having brought back with fitting honor to the church he governed so well the remains of Flavian of holy memory, an innocent and Catholic bishop.[20] Pulcherias time as Augusta was also marked with war and ongoing conflict with Persia. Pulcheria had inspired war against Persia when Persian King Yazdegerd I executed a Christian bishop who destroyed an Zoroastrian altar.[21] Under the influence of Pulcheria, Theodosius sent troops into battle against Persia, the fanaticism over the war by the people of the empire was described by Sozomen as ready to do anything for the sake of Christianity.[21] Pulcheria and Theodosius were victorious in their invasion of Persia, and according to historians Theodosius had credited his sisters vow of virginity as the reason for victory. Surviving letters identify the source of that victory through the vows of his sisters. In his view, when Pulcheria devoted her virginity to God and imposed the same vow on her sisters, she secured Gods favor, causing every threat and war raised against her brother to disperse spontaneously.[22] Theodosius had made his sisters virginity a tool of war propaganda, and because of her vow to be faithful only to God the hand of God would help Roman troops in battle against Persia. Pulcherias power would become even greater after the death of her brother Theodosius II.Aelia Pulcheria (January 19, 398 or 399 – 453) was the daughter of Eastern Roman Emperor Arcadius and Empress Aelia Eudoxia. She was the second child born to Arcadius and Eudoxia. Her older sister was Flaccilla, who was born in 397 but is assumed to have died young. Her younger siblings were Arcadia, born in 400, Theodosius II, the future emperor, and Marina, both born in 401.[1] When her father Arcadius died in 408, her brother Theodosius II was made Emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire, at seven years old. On July 4, 414 a fifteen-year-old Pulcheria proclaimed herself regent over her brother, then thirteen years of age, and made herself Augusta and Empress of the Eastern Roman Empire. According to the ancient historian Sozomen, in his Ecclesiastical History, Pulcheria took a vow of virginity when she became Augusta, and her sisters followed suit. Theodosius II died on July 26, 450, and Pulcheria soon married Marcian on November 25, 450. Marcian and Pulcheria were proclaimed Emperor and Empress of the Eastern Roman Empire. Three years later, in July 453, Pulcheria died; she was later made a saint by the Church.[2] Pulcheria is known to have held a significant amount of power in her brothers reign as emperor. Pulcheria was also of great influence over the church and theological practices of this time. She had influence over anti-pagan policies, church building projects, and the debate over the Marian title Theotokos (Birth-giver to God).Contents  [hide] 1 Biography1.1 Early life1.2 The Emperors Guardian1.3 Vow of virginity1.4 Augusta1.5 Empress1.5.1 Church conflict1.6 Death2 Relationship with Aelia Eudocia3 Influence over the church4 See also5 Notes6 ReferencesBiography[edit]Early life[edit]Pulcheria was born into the royal House of Theodosius, a dynasty of the later Roman empire, ruling in Constantinople. Her father was Arcadius, and her mother was Aelia Eudoxia. Like Pulcheria, her mother was also powerful and of great influence over the church, however not in the same way Pulcheria was. Arcadius reign was marked by the conflict between his wife and the Bishop of Constantinople,“Although his reign (Arcadius) was short, it is remembered in part for the controversial conflicts Eudoxia encountered with John Chrysostom, bishop of Constantinople from 398 to 404.[3] According to the ancient historian Sozomen, in his Ecclesiastical History, Sozomen claims that much of the rivalry was based on an ornate statue made in the honor of Eudoxia which Chrysostom condemned, “The silver statue of the empress...was placed upon a column of porphyry; and the event was celebrated by loud acclamations, dancing, games, and other manifestations of public rejoicing...John declared that these proceedings reflected dishonor on the church.”[4] According to Sozomen, John had also condemned the empress for her grandiose style of ruling over the empire and condemned her in the church, this of course enraged the empress and John was immediately disposed of. Later in life, Pulcheria would bring back the remains of John Chrysostom and make them into relics for the church, in gratitude for his pious life.[5] Eudoxia died in 404 and the emperor Arcadius died in 408. The emperor left behind four young children, including a seven-year-old Theodosius II. Theodosius was made emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire in 408, immediately after his father died. Two praetorian prefects were selected as regents over Theodosius, one being Anthemius and the other, Antiochus; both took over as regent. Eventually Pulcheria herself would take over as regent for her brother.The Emperors Guardian[edit]Once Pulcheria came of age, at fifteen, she felt, like her brother, that her family had no need for Antiochus any longer; her brother dismissed him of his duties. She then became her own brother’s regent: “In 412 Pulcheria quarreled with Antiochus, who like Anthemius had served the dynasty faithfully for a number of years, and induced her brother to dismiss him from the duties of praepositus. She then took personal charge of the imperial family, directing its affairs with such authority that she became known in society at large as the emperor’s guardian.”[6] Immediately when Pulcheria took authority over the imperial palace, the palace took on a much more monastic tone compared to that of her mother’s palace. Sozomen describes Pulcheria’s and her sisters pious ways in his Ecclesiastical History: “They all pursue the same mode of life; they are sedulous in their attendance in the house of prayer, and evince great charity towards strangers and the poor...and pass their days and their nights together in singing the praises of God.”[7] Rituals within the imperial palace also included chanting and reciting passages in the scripture, and fasting twice a week.[6] The sisters were known to have given up luxurious jewelry and apparel worn by most women of the imperial court of the past. Pulcheria also took on the role of providing all the training necessary for Theodosius to become a successful emperor, once he came of age. Although the empire was technically to be ruled by Theodosius II when he would come of age, his older sister Pulcheria exercised such profound influence over him all his life that she must be considered the co-regent of the empire until her death in 453. In fact it can be said without exaggeration that Pulcheria gave the identity to her brothers reign.[8] Pulcherias training of Theodosius included, ...how an Emperor must walk, and ride his horse, alone or in procession; how he should sit upon his throne: how to wear his Imperial armor and robes; and how to speak with dignity. By no means must he yield to loud laughter...[9] Not only did Pulcheria train her brother on the duties and customs of becoming an Emperor, but she also made sure Theodosius was trained to be a pious Christian leader. Once Theodosius came of age to rule as sole Emperor, according to many historians, the teachings of his sister had been ignored. “He was by nature kind, affable, easily led...Not only was he foolishly kind; he was careless, and often he was to neglect his duty in the administration of his Empire.”[10] This lack of power that Theodosius exemplified led to Pulcheria taking on a much larger role of authority and influence in the Empire.Vow of virginity[edit]At the same time Pulcheria proclaimed herself as guardian over her brother she also took a vow of virginity, and her sisters did as well. Pulcheria’s reason for a vow of virginity may have been her deeply religious virtue as recorded by Sozomen: “She devoted her virginity to God, and instructed her sisters to do likewise. To avoid cause of scandal and opportunities for intrigue, she permitted no man to enter her palace. In confirmation of her resolution she took God, the priests, and all the subjects of the Roman empire as witnesses...”[11] Another contemporary of Pulcheria had also described her deep piety. In a letter from Pope Leo I to Pulcheria, he compliments her on her deeply religious ways: In it you clearly show how much you love the Catholic faith and how much you despise the errors of heretics.[12] Along with being deeply pious, it is possible that Pulcheria may have had other motives to take a vow of virginity. According to ancient historians Sozomen, Socrates, and Theodoret, Pulcheria had a deep dislike for Anthemius, the former guardian of Theodosius;[13] the reasons may have been his distaste for her immense power within the empire and her unwillingness to allow Anthemius to gain power amongst the imperial court. A more recent historian, Kenneth Holum, states that Anthemius had tried to make family ties between himself and the imperial family: “Married long since and many years Pulcheria’s senior, Anthemis naturally proposed a descendent or close relative, a grandson perhaps...born a few years earlier than Pulcheria and an excellent prospect for her hand”[14] Pulcheria had found herself in a position where she would have to give her power up to her potential husband, for once a woman in the imperial court married her power was to be relinquished to her husband. In order for Pulcheria to keep her power within the imperial court she took a vow of virginity to ensure that another man could not share her power.Augusta[edit]In 414 the Roman senate made Pulcheria Augusta. During her time as Augusta, Pulcheria held a great deal of power in politics and although she was a woman was treated equally among other men of power.

In order for Pulcheria to keep her power within the imperial court she took a vow of virginity to ensure that another man could not share her power.Augusta[edit]In 414 the Roman senate made Pulcheria Augusta. During her time as Augusta, Pulcheria held a great deal of power in politics and although she was a woman was treated equally among other men of power. In the senate of Constantinople lay a bust in her honor along with the other Augusti.[15] Many important events occurred during her time as Augusta and her brothers reign as emperor; however, Pulcheria’s influence was mostly in the church. Pulcheria and her brother were known to have harbored anti Jewish sentiment, and both had started to enact laws against Jewish worship in the city of Constantinople. Before the reign of Theodosius II, synagogues were seen as private property and were protected by the imperial government. In Theodosius’s reign he enacted a law that forbade the construction of synagogues, and demanded the destruction of synagogues as well. Pulcheria and Theodosius also ordered that a group of Jews be killed after strife amongst Christians emerged in Palestine.[16] It was well known that Pulcheria had little respect for Jewish people, stemmed by her disapproval of Nestorian theological practices; Kenneth Holum writes “Pulcheria had long nursed a special hatred for Jews, and the Nestorian heresy, which appeared to contemporaries to be of Jewish origin; no doubt had served to confirm that hatred.”[17] Although Pulcheria was known to have strong feelings against pagans and Jews alike, she was known for her philanthropic spirit as well. She had built many churches in and around the city of Constantinople, she had also built many buildings for the poor in the city Sozomen writes that it would take too much time to describe all the churches Pulcheria built, as well as hospitals and inns for the poor.[18] Pulcherias building projects were so vast in Constantinople that a whole district was named in her honor called the Pulcherianai, Some of these establishments were extensive enough to give the names of their proprietors to entire quarters of the city such as the Marina quarter in the second region and the Pulcherianai in the eleventh.[19] As well as contributing to the city with new churches and districts, Pulcheria contributed significantly to the church by bringing back bishops or remains of bishops who had once been dismissed as relics to the church. Pope Leo I describes Pulcherias contributions to the church in a letter to her, ...the entire Roman Church is most grateful to you for all the works of your faith, whether having assisted envoys in every way with devoted affection and for having brought back the Catholic bishops who were ejected from their churches by an unjust sentence, or for having brought back with fitting honor to the church he governed so well the remains of Flavian of holy memory, an innocent and Catholic bishop.[20] Pulcherias time as Augusta was also marked with war and ongoing conflict with Persia. Pulcheria had inspired war against Persia when Persian King Yazdegerd I executed a Christian bishop who destroyed an Zoroastrian altar.[21] Under the influence of Pulcheria, Theodosius sent troops into battle against Persia, the fanaticism over the war by the people of the empire was described by Sozomen as ready to do anything for the sake of Christianity.[21] Pulcheria and Theodosius were victorious in their invasion of Persia, and according to historians Theodosius had credited his sisters vow of virginity as the reason for victory. Surviving letters identify the source of that victory through the vows of his sisters. In his view, when Pulcheria devoted her virginity to God and imposed the same vow on her sisters, she secured Gods favor, causing every threat and war raised against her brother to disperse spontaneously.[22] Theodosius had made his sisters virginity a tool of war propaganda, and because of her vow to be faithful only to God the hand of God would help Roman troops in battle against Persia. Pulcherias power would become even greater after the death of her brother Theodosius II.Aelia Pulcheria (January 19, 398 or 399 – 453) was the daughter of Eastern Roman Emperor Arcadius and Empress Aelia Eudoxia. She was the second child born to Arcadius and Eudoxia. Her older sister was Flaccilla, who was born in 397 but is assumed to have died young. Her younger siblings were Arcadia, born in 400, Theodosius II, the future emperor, and Marina, both born in 401.[1] When her father Arcadius died in 408, her brother Theodosius II was made Emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire, at seven years old. On July 4, 414 a fifteen-year-old Pulcheria proclaimed herself regent over her brother, then thirteen years of age, and made herself Augusta and Empress of the Eastern Roman Empire. According to the ancient historian Sozomen, in his Ecclesiastical History, Pulcheria took a vow of virginity when she became Augusta, and her sisters followed suit. Theodosius II died on July 26, 450, and Pulcheria soon married Marcian on November 25, 450. Marcian and Pulcheria were proclaimed Emperor and Empress of the Eastern Roman Empire. Three years later, in July 453, Pulcheria died; she was later made a saint by the Church.[2] Pulcheria is known to have held a significant amount of power in her brothers reign as emperor. Pulcheria was also of great influence over the church and theological practices of this time. She had influence over anti-pagan policies, church building projects, and the debate over the Marian title Theotokos (Birth-giver to God).Contents  [hide] 1 Biography1.1 Early life1.2 The Emperors Guardian1.3 Vow of virginity1.4 Augusta1.5 Empress1.5.1 Church conflict1.6 Death2 Relationship with Aelia Eudocia3 Influence over the church4 See also5 Notes6 ReferencesBiography[edit]Early life[edit]Pulcheria was born into the royal House of Theodosius, a dynasty of the later Roman empire, ruling in Constantinople. Her father was Arcadius, and her mother was Aelia Eudoxia. Like Pulcheria, her mother was also powerful and of great influence over the church, however not in the same way Pulcheria was. Arcadius reign was marked by the conflict between his wife and the Bishop of Constantinople,“Although his reign (Arcadius) was short, it is remembered in part for the controversial conflicts Eudoxia encountered with John Chrysostom, bishop of Constantinople from 398 to 404.[3] According to the ancient historian Sozomen, in his Ecclesiastical History, Sozomen claims that much of the rivalry was based on an ornate statue made in the honor of Eudoxia which Chrysostom condemned, “The silver statue of the empress...was placed upon a column of porphyry; and the event was celebrated by loud acclamations, dancing, games, and other manifestations of public rejoicing...John declared that these proceedings reflected dishonor on the church.”[4] According to Sozomen, John had also condemned the empress for her grandiose style of ruling over the empire and condemned her in the church, this of course enraged the empress and John was immediately disposed of. Later in life, Pulcheria would bring back the remains of John Chrysostom and make them into relics for the church, in gratitude for his pious life.[5] Eudoxia died in 404 and the emperor Arcadius died in 408. The emperor left behind four young children, including a seven-year-old Theodosius II. Theodosius was made emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire in 408, immediately after his father died. Two praetorian prefects were selected as regents over Theodosius, one being Anthemius and the other, Antiochus; both took over as regent. Eventually Pulcheria herself would take over as regent for her brother.The Emperors Guardian[edit]Once Pulcheria came of age, at fifteen, she felt, like her brother, that her family had no need for Antiochus any longer; her brother dismissed him of his duties. She then became her own brother’s regent: “In 412 Pulcheria quarreled with Antiochus, who like Anthemius had served the dynasty faithfully for a number of years, and induced her brother to dismiss him from the duties of praepositus. She then took personal charge of the imperial family, directing its affairs with such authority that she became known in society at large as the emperor’s guardian.”[6] Immediately when Pulcheria took authority over the imperial palace, the palace took on a much more monastic tone compared to that of her mother’s palace. Sozomen describes Pulcheria’s and her sisters pious ways in his Ecclesiastical History: “They all pursue the same mode of life; they are sedulous in their attendance in the house of prayer, and evince great charity towards strangers and the poor...and pass their days and their nights together in singing the praises of God.”[7] Rituals within the imperial palace also included chanting and reciting passages in the scripture, and fasting twice a week.[6] The sisters were known to have given up luxurious jewelry and apparel worn by most women of the imperial court of the past. Pulcheria also took on the role of providing all the training necessary for Theodosius to become a successful emperor, once he came of age. Although the empire was technically to be ruled by Theodosius II when he would come of age, his older sister Pulcheria exercised such profound influence over him all his life that she must be considered the co-regent of the empire until her death in 453. In fact it can be said without exaggeration that Pulcheria gave the identity to her brothers reign.[8] Pulcherias training of Theodosius included, ...how an Emperor must walk, and ride his horse, alone or in procession; how he should sit upon his throne: how to wear his Imperial armor and robes; and how to speak with dignity. By no means must he yield to loud laughter...[9] Not only did Pulcheria train her brother on the duties and customs of becoming an Emperor, but she also made sure Theodosius was trained to be a pious Christian leader. Once Theodosius came of age to rule as sole Emperor, according to many historians, the teachings of his sister had been ignored. “He was by nature kind, affable, easily led...Not only was he foolishly kind; he was careless, and often he was to neglect his duty in the administration of his Empire.”[10] This lack of power that Theodosius exemplified led to Pulcheria taking on a much larger role of authority and influence in the Empire.Vow of virginity[edit]At the same time Pulcheria proclaimed herself as guardian over her brother she also took a vow of virginity, and her sisters did as well. Pulcheria’s reason for a vow of virginity may have been her deeply religious virtue as recorded by Sozomen: “She devoted her virginity to God, and instructed her sisters to do likewise. To avoid cause of scandal and opportunities for intrigue, she permitted no man to enter her palace. In confirmation of her resolution she took God, the priests, and all the subjects of the Roman empire as witnesses...”[11] Another contemporary of Pulcheria had also described her deep piety. In a letter from Pope Leo I to Pulcheria, he compliments her on her deeply religious ways: In it you clearly show how much you love the Catholic faith and how much you despise the errors of heretics.[12] Along with being deeply pious, it is possible that Pulcheria may have had other motives to take a vow of virginity. According to ancient historians Sozomen, Socrates, and Theodoret, Pulcheria had a deep dislike for Anthemius, the former guardian of Theodosius;[13] the reasons may have been his distaste for her immense power within the empire and her unwillingness to allow Anthemius to gain power amongst the imperial court.

According to ancient historians Sozomen, Socrates, and Theodoret, Pulcheria had a deep dislike for Anthemius, the former guardian of Theodosius;[13] the reasons may have been his distaste for her immense power within the empire and her unwillingness to allow Anthemius to gain power amongst the imperial court. A more recent historian, Kenneth Holum, states that Anthemius had tried to make family ties between himself and the imperial family: “Married long since and many years Pulcheria’s senior, Anthemis naturally proposed a descendent or close relative, a grandson perhaps...born a few years earlier than Pulcheria and an excellent prospect for her hand”[14] Pulcheria had found herself in a position where she would have to give her power up to her potential husband, for once a woman in the imperial court married her power was to be relinquished to her husband. In order for Pulcheria to keep her power within the imperial court she took a vow of virginity to ensure that another man could not share her power.Augusta[edit]In 414 the Roman senate made Pulcheria Augusta. During her time as Augusta, Pulcheria held a great deal of power in politics and although she was a woman was treated equally among other men of power. In the senate of Constantinople lay a bust in her honor along with the other Augusti.[15] Many important events occurred during her time as Augusta and her brothers reign as emperor; however, Pulcheria’s influence was mostly in the church. Pulcheria and her brother were known to have harbored anti Jewish sentiment, and both had started to enact laws against Jewish worship in the city of Constantinople. Before the reign of Theodosius II, synagogues were seen as private property and were protected by the imperial government. In Theodosius’s reign he enacted a law that forbade the construction of synagogues, and demanded the destruction of synagogues as well. Pulcheria and Theodosius also ordered that a group of Jews be killed after strife amongst Christians emerged in Palestine.[16] It was well known that Pulcheria had little respect for Jewish people, stemmed by her disapproval of Nestorian theological practices; Kenneth Holum writes “Pulcheria had long nursed a special hatred for Jews, and the Nestorian heresy, which appeared to contemporaries to be of Jewish origin; no doubt had served to confirm that hatred.”[17] Although Pulcheria was known to have strong feelings against pagans and Jews alike, she was known for her philanthropic spirit as well. She had built many churches in and around the city of Constantinople, she had also built many buildings for the poor in the city Sozomen writes that it would take too much time to describe all the churches Pulcheria built, as well as hospitals and inns for the poor.[18] Pulcherias building projects were so vast in Constantinople that a whole district was named in her honor called the Pulcherianai, Some of these establishments were extensive enough to give the names of their proprietors to entire quarters of the city such as the Marina quarter in the second region and the Pulcherianai in the eleventh.[19] As well as contributing to the city with new churches and districts, Pulcheria contributed significantly to the church by bringing back bishops or remains of bishops who had once been dismissed as relics to the church. Pope Leo I describes Pulcherias contributions to the church in a letter to her, ...the entire Roman Church is most grateful to you for all the works of your faith, whether having assisted envoys in every way with devoted affection and for having brought back the Catholic bishops who were ejected from their churches by an unjust sentence, or for having brought back with fitting honor to the church he governed so well the remains of Flavian of holy memory, an innocent and Catholic bishop.[20] Pulcherias time as Augusta was also marked with war and ongoing conflict with Persia. Pulcheria had inspired war against Persia when Persian King Yazdegerd I executed a Christian bishop who destroyed an Zoroastrian altar.[21] Under the influence of Pulcheria, Theodosius sent troops into battle against Persia, the fanaticism over the war by the people of the empire was described by Sozomen as ready to do anything for the sake of Christianity.[21] Pulcheria and Theodosius were victorious in their invasion of Persia, and according to historians Theodosius had credited his sisters vow of virginity as the reason for victory. Surviving letters identify the source of that victory through the vows of his sisters. In his view, when Pulcheria devoted her virginity to God and imposed the same vow on her sisters, she secured Gods favor, causing every threat and war raised against her brother to disperse spontaneously.[22] Theodosius had made his sisters virginity a tool of war propaganda, and because of her vow to be faithful only to God the hand of God would help Roman troops in battle against Persia. Pulcherias power would become even greater after the death of her brother Theodosius II.Aelia Pulcheria (January 19, 398 or 399 – 453) was the daughter of Eastern Roman Emperor Arcadius and Empress Aelia Eudoxia. She was the second child born to Arcadius and Eudoxia. Her older sister was Flaccilla, who was born in 397 but is assumed to have died young. Her younger siblings were Arcadia, born in 400, Theodosius II, the future emperor, and Marina, both born in 401.[1] When her father Arcadius died in 408, her brother Theodosius II was made Emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire, at seven years old. On July 4, 414 a fifteen-year-old Pulcheria proclaimed herself regent over her brother, then thirteen years of age, and made herself Augusta and Empress of the Eastern Roman Empire. According to the ancient historian Sozomen, in his Ecclesiastical History, Pulcheria took a vow of virginity when she became Augusta, and her sisters followed suit. Theodosius II died on July 26, 450, and Pulcheria soon married Marcian on November 25, 450. Marcian and Pulcheria were proclaimed Emperor and Empress of the Eastern Roman Empire. Three years later, in July 453, Pulcheria died; she was later made a saint by the Church.[2] Pulcheria is known to have held a significant amount of power in her brothers reign as emperor. Pulcheria was also of great influence over the church and theological practices of this time. She had influence over anti-pagan policies, church building projects, and the debate over the Marian title Theotokos (Birth-giver to God).Contents  [hide] 1 Biography1.1 Early life1.2 The Emperors Guardian1.3 Vow of virginity1.4 Augusta1.5 Empress1.5.1 Church conflict1.6 Death2 Relationship with Aelia Eudocia3 Influence over the church4 See also5 Notes6 ReferencesBiography[edit]Early life[edit]Pulcheria was born into the royal House of Theodosius, a dynasty of the later Roman empire, ruling in Constantinople. Her father was Arcadius, and her mother was Aelia Eudoxia. Like Pulcheria, her mother was also powerful and of great influence over the church, however not in the same way Pulcheria was. Arcadius reign was marked by the conflict between his wife and the Bishop of Constantinople,“Although his reign (Arcadius) was short, it is remembered in part for the controversial conflicts Eudoxia encountered with John Chrysostom, bishop of Constantinople from 398 to 404.[3] According to the ancient historian Sozomen, in his Ecclesiastical History, Sozomen claims that much of the rivalry was based on an ornate statue made in the honor of Eudoxia which Chrysostom condemned, “The silver statue of the empress...was placed upon a column of porphyry; and the event was celebrated by loud acclamations, dancing, games, and other manifestations of public rejoicing...John declared that these proceedings reflected dishonor on the church.”[4] According to Sozomen, John had also condemned the empress for her grandiose style of ruling over the empire and condemned her in the church, this of course enraged the empress and John was immediately disposed of. Later in life, Pulcheria would bring back the remains of John Chrysostom and make them into relics for the church, in gratitude for his pious life.[5] Eudoxia died in 404 and the emperor Arcadius died in 408. The emperor left behind four young children, including a seven-year-old Theodosius II. Theodosius was made emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire in 408, immediately after his father died. Two praetorian prefects were selected as regents over Theodosius, one being Anthemius and the other, Antiochus; both took over as regent. Eventually Pulcheria herself would take over as regent for her brother.The Emperors Guardian[edit]Once Pulcheria came of age, at fifteen, she felt, like her brother, that her family had no need for Antiochus any longer; her brother dismissed him of his duties. She then became her own brother’s regent: “In 412 Pulcheria quarreled with Antiochus, who like Anthemius had served the dynasty faithfully for a number of years, and induced her brother to dismiss him from the duties of praepositus. She then took personal charge of the imperial family, directing its affairs with such authority that she became known in society at large as the emperor’s guardian.”[6] Immediately when Pulcheria took authority over the imperial palace, the palace took on a much more monastic tone compared to that of her mother’s palace. Sozomen describes Pulcheria’s and her sisters pious ways in his Ecclesiastical History: “They all pursue the same mode of life; they are sedulous in their attendance in the house of prayer, and evince great charity towards strangers and the poor...and pass their days and their nights together in singing the praises of God.”[7] Rituals within the imperial palace also included chanting and reciting passages in the scripture, and fasting twice a week.[6] The sisters were known to have given up luxurious jewelry and apparel worn by most women of the imperial court of the past. Pulcheria also took on the role of providing all the training necessary for Theodosius to become a successful emperor, once he came of age. Although the empire was technically to be ruled by Theodosius II when he would come of age, his older sister Pulcheria exercised such profound influence over him all his life that she must be considered the co-regent of the empire until her death in 453. In fact it can be said without exaggeration that Pulcheria gave the identity to her brothers reign.[8] Pulcherias training of Theodosius included, ...how an Emperor must walk, and ride his horse, alone or in procession; how he should sit upon his throne: how to wear his Imperial armor and robes; and how to speak with dignity. By no means must he yield to loud laughter...[9] Not only did Pulcheria train her brother on the duties and customs of becoming an Emperor, but she also made sure Theodosius was trained to be a pious Christian leader. Once Theodosius came of age to rule as sole Emperor, according to many historians, the teachings of his sister had been ignored. “He was by nature kind, affable, easily led...Not only was he foolishly kind; he was careless, and often he was to neglect his duty in the administration of his Empire.”[10] This lack of power that Theodosius exemplified led to Pulcheria taking on a much larger role of authority and influence in the Empire.Vow of virginity[edit]At the same time Pulcheria proclaimed herself as guardian over her brother she also took a vow of virginity, and her sisters did as well. Pulcheria’s reason for a vow of virginity may have been her deeply religious virtue as recorded by Sozomen: “She devoted her virginity to God, and instructed her sisters to do likewise. To avoid cause of scandal and opportunities for intrigue, she permitted no man to enter her palace. In confirmation of her resolution she took God, the priests, and all the subjects of the Roman empire as witnesses...”[11] Another contemporary of Pulcheria had also described her deep piety. In a letter from Pope Leo I to Pulcheria, he compliments her on her deeply religious ways: In it you clearly show how much you love the Catholic faith and how much you despise the errors of heretics.[12] Along with being deeply pious, it is possible that Pulcheria may have had other motives to take a vow of virginity.

In a letter from Pope Leo I to Pulcheria, he compliments her on her deeply religious ways: In it you clearly show how much you love the Catholic faith and how much you despise the errors of heretics.[12] Along with being deeply pious, it is possible that Pulcheria may have had other motives to take a vow of virginity. According to ancient historians Sozomen, Socrates, and Theodoret, Pulcheria had a deep dislike for Anthemius, the former guardian of Theodosius;[13] the reasons may have been his distaste for her immense power within the empire and her unwillingness to allow Anthemius to gain power amongst the imperial court. A more recent historian, Kenneth Holum, states that Anthemius had tried to make family ties between himself and the imperial family: “Married long since and many years Pulcheria’s senior, Anthemis naturally proposed a descendent or close relative, a grandson perhaps...born a few years earlier than Pulcheria and an excellent prospect for her hand”[14] Pulcheria had found herself in a position where she would have to give her power up to her potential husband, for once a woman in the imperial court married her power was to be relinquished to her husband. In order for Pulcheria to keep her power within the imperial court she took a vow of virginity to ensure that another man could not share her power.Augusta[edit]In 414 the Roman senate made Pulcheria Augusta. During her time as Augusta, Pulcheria held a great deal of power in politics and although she was a woman was treated equally among other men of power. In the senate of Constantinople lay a bust in her honor along with the other Augusti.[15] Many important events occurred during her time as Augusta and her brothers reign as emperor; however, Pulcheria’s influence was mostly in the church. Pulcheria and her brother were known to have harbored anti Jewish sentiment, and both had started to enact laws against Jewish worship in the city of Constantinople. Before the reign of Theodosius II, synagogues were seen as private property and were protected by the imperial government. In Theodosius’s reign he enacted a law that forbade the construction of synagogues, and demanded the destruction of synagogues as well. Pulcheria and Theodosius also ordered that a group of Jews be killed after strife amongst Christians emerged in Palestine.[16] It was well known that Pulcheria had little respect for Jewish people, stemmed by her disapproval of Nestorian theological practices; Kenneth Holum writes “Pulcheria had long nursed a special hatred for Jews, and the Nestorian heresy, which appeared to contemporaries to be of Jewish origin; no doubt had served to confirm that hatred.”[17] Although Pulcheria was known to have strong feelings against pagans and Jews alike, she was known for her philanthropic spirit as well. She had built many churches in and around the city of Constantinople, she had also built many buildings for the poor in the city Sozomen writes that it would take too much time to describe all the churches Pulcheria built, as well as hospitals and inns for the poor.[18] Pulcherias building projects were so vast in Constantinople that a whole district was named in her honor called the Pulcherianai, Some of these establishments were extensive enough to give the names of their proprietors to entire quarters of the city such as the Marina quarter in the second region and the Pulcherianai in the eleventh.[19] As well as contributing to the city with new churches and districts, Pulcheria contributed significantly to the church by bringing back bishops or remains of bishops who had once been dismissed as relics to the church. Pope Leo I describes Pulcherias contributions to the church in a letter to her, ...the entire Roman Church is most grateful to you for all the works of your faith, whether having assisted envoys in every way with devoted affection and for having brought back the Catholic bishops who were ejected from their churches by an unjust sentence, or for having brought back with fitting honor to the church he governed so well the remains of Flavian of holy memory, an innocent and Catholic bishop.[20] Pulcherias time as Augusta was also marked with war and ongoing conflict with Persia. Pulcheria had inspired war against Persia when Persian King Yazdegerd I executed a Christian bishop who destroyed an Zoroastrian altar.[21] Under the influence of Pulcheria, Theodosius sent troops into battle against Persia, the fanaticism over the war by the people of the empire was described by Sozomen as ready to do anything for the sake of Christianity.[21] Pulcheria and Theodosius were victorious in their invasion of Persia, and according to historians Theodosius had credited his sisters vow of virginity as the reason for victory. Surviving letters identify the source of that victory through the vows of his sisters. In his view, when Pulcheria devoted her virginity to God and imposed the same vow on her sisters, she secured Gods favor, causing every threat and war raised against her brother to disperse spontaneously.[22] Theodosius had made his sisters virginity a tool of war propaganda, and because of her vow to be faithful only to God the hand of God would help Roman troops in battle against Persia. Pulcherias power would become even greater after the death of her brother Theodosius II.Aelia Pulcheria (January 19, 398 or 399 – 453) was the daughter of Eastern Roman Emperor Arcadius and Empress Aelia Eudoxia. She was the second child born to Arcadius and Eudoxia. Her older sister was Flaccilla, who was born in 397 but is assumed to have died young. Her younger siblings were Arcadia, born in 400, Theodosius II, the future emperor, and Marina, both born in 401.[1] When her father Arcadius died in 408, her brother Theodosius II was made Emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire, at seven years old. On July 4, 414 a fifteen-year-old Pulcheria proclaimed herself regent over her brother, then thirteen years of age, and made herself Augusta and Empress of the Eastern Roman Empire. According to the ancient historian Sozomen, in his Ecclesiastical History, Pulcheria took a vow of virginity when she became Augusta, and her sisters followed suit. Theodosius II died on July 26, 450, and Pulcheria soon married Marcian on November 25, 450. Marcian and Pulcheria were proclaimed Emperor and Empress of the Eastern Roman Empire. Three years later, in July 453, Pulcheria died; she was later made a saint by the Church.[2] Pulcheria is known to have held a significant amount of power in her brothers reign as emperor. Pulcheria was also of great influence over the church and theological practices of this time. She had influence over anti-pagan policies, church building projects, and the debate over the Marian title Theotokos (Birth-giver to God).Contents  [hide] 1 Biography1.1 Early life1.2 The Emperors Guardian1.3 Vow of virginity1.4 Augusta1.5 Empress1.5.1 Church conflict1.6 Death2 Relationship with Aelia Eudocia3 Influence over the church4 See also5 Notes6 ReferencesBiography[edit]Early life[edit]Pulcheria was born into the royal House of Theodosius, a dynasty of the later Roman empire, ruling in Constantinople. Her father was Arcadius, and her mother was Aelia Eudoxia. Like Pulcheria, her mother was also powerful and of great influence over the church, however not in the same way Pulcheria was. Arcadius reign was marked by the conflict between his wife and the Bishop of Constantinople,“Although his reign (Arcadius) was short, it is remembered in part for the controversial conflicts Eudoxia encountered with John Chrysostom, bishop of Constantinople from 398 to 404.[3] According to the ancient historian Sozomen, in his Ecclesiastical History, Sozomen claims that much of the rivalry was based on an ornate statue made in the honor of Eudoxia which Chrysostom condemned, “The silver statue of the empress...was placed upon a column of porphyry; and the event was celebrated by loud acclamations, dancing, games, and other manifestations of public rejoicing...John declared that these proceedings reflected dishonor on the church.”[4] According to Sozomen, John had also condemned the empress for her grandiose style of ruling over the empire and condemned her in the church, this of course enraged the empress and John was immediately disposed of. Later in life, Pulcheria would bring back the remains of John Chrysostom and make them into relics for the church, in gratitude for his pious life.[5] Eudoxia died in 404 and the emperor Arcadius died in 408. The emperor left behind four young children, including a seven-year-old Theodosius II. Theodosius was made emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire in 408, immediately after his father died. Two praetorian prefects were selected as regents over Theodosius, one being Anthemius and the other, Antiochus; both took over as regent. Eventually Pulcheria herself would take over as regent for her brother.The Emperors Guardian[edit]Once Pulcheria came of age, at fifteen, she felt, like her brother, that her family had no need for Antiochus any longer; her brother dismissed him of his duties. She then became her own brother’s regent: “In 412 Pulcheria quarreled with Antiochus, who like Anthemius had served the dynasty faithfully for a number of years, and induced her brother to dismiss him from the duties of praepositus. She then took personal charge of the imperial family, directing its affairs with such authority that she became known in society at large as the emperor’s guardian.”[6] Immediately when Pulcheria took authority over the imperial palace, the palace took on a much more monastic tone compared to that of her mother’s palace. Sozomen describes Pulcheria’s and her sisters pious ways in his Ecclesiastical History: “They all pursue the same mode of life; they are sedulous in their attendance in the house of prayer, and evince great charity towards strangers and the poor...and pass their days and their nights together in singing the praises of God.”[7] Rituals within the imperial palace also included chanting and reciting passages in the scripture, and fasting twice a week.[6] The sisters were known to have given up luxurious jewelry and apparel worn by most women of the imperial court of the past. Pulcheria also took on the role of providing all the training necessary for Theodosius to become a successful emperor, once he came of age. Although the empire was technically to be ruled by Theodosius II when he would come of age, his older sister Pulcheria exercised such profound influence over him all his life that she must be considered the co-regent of the empire until her death in 453. In fact it can be said without exaggeration that Pulcheria gave the identity to her brothers reign.[8] Pulcherias training of Theodosius included, ...how an Emperor must walk, and ride his horse, alone or in procession; how he should sit upon his throne: how to wear his Imperial armor and robes; and how to speak with dignity. By no means must he yield to loud laughter...[9] Not only did Pulcheria train her brother on the duties and customs of becoming an Emperor, but she also made sure Theodosius was trained to be a pious Christian leader. Once Theodosius came of age to rule as sole Emperor, according to many historians, the teachings of his sister had been ignored. “He was by nature kind, affable, easily led...Not only was he foolishly kind; he was careless, and often he was to neglect his duty in the administration of his Empire.”[10] This lack of power that Theodosius exemplified led to Pulcheria taking on a much larger role of authority and influence in the Empire.Vow of virginity[edit]At the same time Pulcheria proclaimed herself as guardian over her brother she also took a vow of virginity, and her sisters did as well. Pulcheria’s reason for a vow of virginity may have been her deeply religious virtue as recorded by Sozomen: “She devoted her virginity to God, and instructed her sisters to do likewise. To avoid cause of scandal and opportunities for intrigue, she permitted no man to enter her palace. In confirmation of her resolution she took God, the priests, and all the subjects of the Roman empire as witnesses...”[11] Another contemporary of Pulcheria had also described her deep piety.

In confirmation of her resolution she took God, the priests, and all the subjects of the Roman empire as witnesses...”[11] Another contemporary of Pulcheria had also described her deep piety. In a letter from Pope Leo I to Pulcheria, he compliments her on her deeply religious ways: In it you clearly show how much you love the Catholic faith and how much you despise the errors of heretics.[12] Along with being deeply pious, it is possible that Pulcheria may have had other motives to take a vow of virginity. According to ancient historians Sozomen, Socrates, and Theodoret, Pulcheria had a deep dislike for Anthemius, the former guardian of Theodosius;[13] the reasons may have been his distaste for her immense power within the empire and her unwillingness to allow Anthemius to gain power amongst the imperial court. A more recent historian, Kenneth Holum, states that Anthemius had tried to make family ties between himself and the imperial family: “Married long since and many years Pulcheria’s senior, Anthemis naturally proposed a descendent or close relative, a grandson perhaps...born a few years earlier than Pulcheria and an excellent prospect for her hand”[14] Pulcheria had found herself in a position where she would have to give her power up to her potential husband, for once a woman in the imperial court married her power was to be relinquished to her husband. In order for Pulcheria to keep her power within the imperial court she took a vow of virginity to ensure that another man could not share her power.Augusta[edit]In 414 the Roman senate made Pulcheria Augusta. During her time as Augusta, Pulcheria held a great deal of power in politics and although she was a woman was treated equally among other men of power. In the senate of Constantinople lay a bust in her honor along with the other Augusti.[15] Many important events occurred during her time as Augusta and her brothers reign as emperor; however, Pulcheria’s influence was mostly in the church. Pulcheria and her brother were known to have harbored anti Jewish sentiment, and both had started to enact laws against Jewish worship in the city of Constantinople. Before the reign of Theodosius II, synagogues were seen as private property and were protected by the imperial government. In Theodosius’s reign he enacted a law that forbade the construction of synagogues, and demanded the destruction of synagogues as well. Pulcheria and Theodosius also ordered that a group of Jews be killed after strife amongst Christians emerged in Palestine.[16] It was well known that Pulcheria had little respect for Jewish people, stemmed by her disapproval of Nestorian theological practices; Kenneth Holum writes “Pulcheria had long nursed a special hatred for Jews, and the Nestorian heresy, which appeared to contemporaries to be of Jewish origin; no doubt had served to confirm that hatred.”[17] Although Pulcheria was known to have strong feelings against pagans and Jews alike, she was known for her philanthropic spirit as well. She had built many churches in and around the city of Constantinople, she had also built many buildings for the poor in the city Sozomen writes that it would take too much time to describe all the churches Pulcheria built, as well as hospitals and inns for the poor.[18] Pulcherias building projects were so vast in Constantinople that a whole district was named in her honor called the Pulcherianai, Some of these establishments were extensive enough to give the names of their proprietors to entire quarters of the city such as the Marina quarter in the second region and the Pulcherianai in the eleventh.[19] As well as contributing to the city with new churches and districts, Pulcheria contributed significantly to the church by bringing back bishops or remains of bishops who had once been dismissed as relics to the church. Pope Leo I describes Pulcherias contributions to the church in a letter to her, ...the entire Roman Church is most grateful to you for all the works of your faith, whether having assisted envoys in every way with devoted affection and for having brought back the Catholic bishops who were ejected from their churches by an unjust sentence, or for having brought back with fitting honor to the church he governed so well the remains of Flavian of holy memory, an innocent and Catholic bishop.[20] Pulcherias time as Augusta was also marked with war and ongoing conflict with Persia. Pulcheria had inspired war against Persia when Persian King Yazdegerd I executed a Christian bishop who destroyed an Zoroastrian altar.[21] Under the influence of Pulcheria, Theodosius sent troops into battle against Persia, the fanaticism over the war by the people of the empire was described by Sozomen as ready to do anything for the sake of Christianity.[21] Pulcheria and Theodosius were victorious in their invasion of Persia, and according to historians Theodosius had credited his sisters vow of virginity as the reason for victory. Surviving letters identify the source of that victory through the vows of his sisters. In his view, when Pulcheria devoted her virginity to God and imposed the same vow on her sisters, she secured Gods favor, causing every threat and war raised against her brother to disperse spontaneously.[22] Theodosius had made his sisters virginity a tool of war propaganda, and because of her vow to be faithful only to God the hand of God would help Roman troops in battle against Persia. Pulcherias power would become even greater after the death of her brother Theodosius II.Aelia Pulcheria (January 19, 398 or 399 – 453) was the daughter of Eastern Roman Emperor Arcadius and Empress Aelia Eudoxia. She was the second child born to Arcadius and Eudoxia. Her older sister was Flaccilla, who was born in 397 but is assumed to have died young. Her younger siblings were Arcadia, born in 400, Theodosius II, the future emperor, and Marina, both born in 401.[1] When her father Arcadius died in 408, her brother Theodosius II was made Emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire, at seven years old. On July 4, 414 a fifteen-year-old Pulcheria proclaimed herself regent over her brother, then thirteen years of age, and made herself Augusta and Empress of the Eastern Roman Empire. According to the ancient historian Sozomen, in his Ecclesiastical History, Pulcheria took a vow of virginity when she became Augusta, and her sisters followed suit. Theodosius II died on July 26, 450, and Pulcheria soon married Marcian on November 25, 450. Marcian and Pulcheria were proclaimed Emperor and Empress of the Eastern Roman Empire. Three years later, in July 453, Pulcheria died; she was later made a saint by the Church.[2] Pulcheria is known to have held a significant amount of power in her brothers reign as emperor. Pulcheria was also of great influence over the church and theological practices of this time. She had influence over anti-pagan policies, church building projects, and the debate over the Marian title Theotokos (Birth-giver to God).Contents  [hide] 1 Biography1.1 Early life1.2 The Emperors Guardian1.3 Vow of virginity1.4 Augusta1.5 Empress1.5.1 Church conflict1.6 Death2 Relationship with Aelia Eudocia3 Influence over the church4 See also5 Notes6 ReferencesBiography[edit]Early life[edit]Pulcheria was born into the royal House of Theodosius, a dynasty of the later Roman empire, ruling in Constantinople. Her father was Arcadius, and her mother was Aelia Eudoxia. Like Pulcheria, her mother was also powerful and of great influence over the church, however not in the same way Pulcheria was. Arcadius reign was marked by the conflict between his wife and the Bishop of Constantinople,“Although his reign (Arcadius) was short, it is remembered in part for the controversial conflicts Eudoxia encountered with John Chrysostom, bishop of Constantinople from 398 to 404.[3] According to the ancient historian Sozomen, in his Ecclesiastical History, Sozomen claims that much of the rivalry was based on an ornate statue made in the honor of Eudoxia which Chrysostom condemned, “The silver statue of the empress...was placed upon a column of porphyry; and the event was celebrated by loud acclamations, dancing, games, and other manifestations of public rejoicing...John declared that these proceedings reflected dishonor on the church.”[4] According to Sozomen, John had also condemned the empress for her grandiose style of ruling over the empire and condemned her in the church, this of course enraged the empress and John was immediately disposed of. Later in life, Pulcheria would bring back the remains of John Chrysostom and make them into relics for the church, in gratitude for his pious life.[5] Eudoxia died in 404 and the emperor Arcadius died in 408. The emperor left behind four young children, including a seven-year-old Theodosius II. Theodosius was made emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire in 408, immediately after his father died. Two praetorian prefects were selected as regents over Theodosius, one being Anthemius and the other, Antiochus; both took over as regent. Eventually Pulcheria herself would take over as regent for her brother.The Emperors Guardian[edit]Once Pulcheria came of age, at fifteen, she felt, like her brother, that her family had no need for Antiochus any longer; her brother dismissed him of his duties. She then became her own brother’s regent: “In 412 Pulcheria quarreled with Antiochus, who like Anthemius had served the dynasty faithfully for a number of years, and induced her brother to dismiss him from the duties of praepositus. She then took personal charge of the imperial family, directing its affairs with such authority that she became known in society at large as the emperor’s guardian.”[6] Immediately when Pulcheria took authority over the imperial palace, the palace took on a much more monastic tone compared to that of her mother’s palace. Sozomen describes Pulcheria’s and her sisters pious ways in his Ecclesiastical History: “They all pursue the same mode of life; they are sedulous in their attendance in the house of prayer, and evince great charity towards strangers and the poor...and pass their days and their nights together in singing the praises of God.”[7] Rituals within the imperial palace also included chanting and reciting passages in the scripture, and fasting twice a week.[6] The sisters were known to have given up luxurious jewelry and apparel worn by most women of the imperial court of the past. Pulcheria also took on the role of providing all the training necessary for Theodosius to become a successful emperor, once he came of age. Although the empire was technically to be ruled by Theodosius II when he would come of age, his older sister Pulcheria exercised such profound influence over him all his life that she must be considered the co-regent of the empire until her death in 453. In fact it can be said without exaggeration that Pulcheria gave the identity to her brothers reign.[8] Pulcherias training of Theodosius included, ...how an Emperor must walk, and ride his horse, alone or in procession; how he should sit upon his throne: how to wear his Imperial armor and robes; and how to speak with dignity. By no means must he yield to loud laughter...[9] Not only did Pulcheria train her brother on the duties and customs of becoming an Emperor, but she also made sure Theodosius was trained to be a pious Christian leader. Once Theodosius came of age to rule as sole Emperor, according to many historians, the teachings of his sister had been ignored. “He was by nature kind, affable, easily led...Not only was he foolishly kind; he was careless, and often he was to neglect his duty in the administration of his Empire.”[10] This lack of power that Theodosius exemplified led to Pulcheria taking on a much larger role of authority and influence in the Empire.Vow of virginity[edit]At the same time Pulcheria proclaimed herself as guardian over her brother she also took a vow of virginity, and her sisters did as well. Pulcheria’s reason for a vow of virginity may have been her deeply religious virtue as recorded by Sozomen: “She devoted her virginity to God, and instructed her sisters to do likewise. To avoid cause of scandal and opportunities for intrigue, she permitted no man to enter her palace.

To avoid cause of scandal and opportunities for intrigue, she permitted no man to enter her palace. In confirmation of her resolution she took God, the priests, and all the subjects of the Roman empire as witnesses...”[11] Another contemporary of Pulcheria had also described her deep piety. In a letter from Pope Leo I to Pulcheria, he compliments her on her deeply religious ways: In it you clearly show how much you love the Catholic faith and how much you despise the errors of heretics.[12] Along with being deeply pious, it is possible that Pulcheria may have had other motives to take a vow of virginity. According to ancient historians Sozomen, Socrates, and Theodoret, Pulcheria had a deep dislike for Anthemius, the former guardian of Theodosius;[13] the reasons may have been his distaste for her immense power within the empire and her unwillingness to allow Anthemius to gain power amongst the imperial court. A more recent historian, Kenneth Holum, states that Anthemius had tried to make family ties between himself and the imperial family: “Married long since and many years Pulcheria’s senior, Anthemis naturally proposed a descendent or close relative, a grandson perhaps...born a few years earlier than Pulcheria and an excellent prospect for her hand”[14] Pulcheria had found herself in a position where she would have to give her power up to her potential husband, for once a woman in the imperial court married her power was to be relinquished to her husband. In order for Pulcheria to keep her power within the imperial court she took a vow of virginity to ensure that another man could not share her power.Augusta[edit]In 414 the Roman senate made Pulcheria Augusta. During her time as Augusta, Pulcheria held a great deal of power in politics and although she was a woman was treated equally among other men of power. In the senate of Constantinople lay a bust in her honor along with the other Augusti.[15] Many important events occurred during her time as Augusta and her brothers reign as emperor; however, Pulcheria’s influence was mostly in the church. Pulcheria and her brother were known to have harbored anti Jewish sentiment, and both had started to enact laws against Jewish worship in the city of Constantinople. Before the reign of Theodosius II, synagogues were seen as private property and were protected by the imperial government. In Theodosius’s reign he enacted a law that forbade the construction of synagogues, and demanded the destruction of synagogues as well. Pulcheria and Theodosius also ordered that a group of Jews be killed after strife amongst Christians emerged in Palestine.[16] It was well known that Pulcheria had little respect for Jewish people, stemmed by her disapproval of Nestorian theological practices; Kenneth Holum writes “Pulcheria had long nursed a special hatred for Jews, and the Nestorian heresy, which appeared to contemporaries to be of Jewish origin; no doubt had served to confirm that hatred.”[17] Although Pulcheria was known to have strong feelings against pagans and Jews alike, she was known for her philanthropic spirit as well. She had built many churches in and around the city of Constantinople, she had also built many buildings for the poor in the city Sozomen writes that it would take too much time to describe all the churches Pulcheria built, as well as hospitals and inns for the poor.[18] Pulcherias building projects were so vast in Constantinople that a whole district was named in her honor called the Pulcherianai, Some of these establishments were extensive enough to give the names of their proprietors to entire quarters of the city such as the Marina quarter in the second region and the Pulcherianai in the eleventh.[19] As well as contributing to the city with new churches and districts, Pulcheria contributed significantly to the church by bringing back bishops or remains of bishops who had once been dismissed as relics to the church. Pope Leo I describes Pulcherias contributions to the church in a letter to her, ...the entire Roman Church is most grateful to you for all the works of your faith, whether having assisted envoys in every way with devoted affection and for having brought back the Catholic bishops who were ejected from their churches by an unjust sentence, or for having brought back with fitting honor to the church he governed so well the remains of Flavian of holy memory, an innocent and Catholic bishop.[20] Pulcherias time as Augusta was also marked with war and ongoing conflict with Persia. Pulcheria had inspired war against Persia when Persian King Yazdegerd I executed a Christian bishop who destroyed an Zoroastrian altar.[21] Under the influence of Pulcheria, Theodosius sent troops into battle against Persia, the fanaticism over the war by the people of the empire was described by Sozomen as ready to do anything for the sake of Christianity.[21] Pulcheria and Theodosius were victorious in their invasion of Persia, and according to historians Theodosius had credited his sisters vow of virginity as the reason for victory. Surviving letters identify the source of that victory through the vows of his sisters. In his view, when Pulcheria devoted her virginity to God and imposed the same vow on her sisters, she secured Gods favor, causing every threat and war raised against her brother to disperse spontaneously.[22] Theodosius had made his sisters virginity a tool of war propaganda, and because of her vow to be faithful only to God the hand of God would help Roman troops in battle against Persia. Pulcherias power would become even greater after the death of her brother Theodosius II.Aelia Pulcheria (January 19, 398 or 399 – 453) was the daughter of Eastern Roman Emperor Arcadius and Empress Aelia Eudoxia. She was the second child born to Arcadius and Eudoxia. Her older sister was Flaccilla, who was born in 397 but is assumed to have died young. Her younger siblings were Arcadia, born in 400, Theodosius II, the future emperor, and Marina, both born in 401.[1] When her father Arcadius died in 408, her brother Theodosius II was made Emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire, at seven years old. On July 4, 414 a fifteen-year-old Pulcheria proclaimed herself regent over her brother, then thirteen years of age, and made herself Augusta and Empress of the Eastern Roman Empire. According to the ancient historian Sozomen, in his Ecclesiastical History, Pulcheria took a vow of virginity when she became Augusta, and her sisters followed suit. Theodosius II died on July 26, 450, and Pulcheria soon married Marcian on November 25, 450. Marcian and Pulcheria were proclaimed Emperor and Empress of the Eastern Roman Empire. Three years later, in July 453, Pulcheria died; she was later made a saint by the Church.[2] Pulcheria is known to have held a significant amount of power in her brothers reign as emperor. Pulcheria was also of great influence over the church and theological practices of this time. She had influence over anti-pagan policies, church building projects, and the debate over the Marian title Theotokos (Birth-giver to God).Contents  [hide] 1 Biography1.1 Early life1.2 The Emperors Guardian1.3 Vow of virginity1.4 Augusta1.5 Empress1.5.1 Church conflict1.6 Death2 Relationship with Aelia Eudocia3 Influence over the church4 See also5 Notes6 ReferencesBiography[edit]Early life[edit]Pulcheria was born into the royal House of Theodosius, a dynasty of the later Roman empire, ruling in Constantinople. Her father was Arcadius, and her mother was Aelia Eudoxia. Like Pulcheria, her mother was also powerful and of great influence over the church, however not in the same way Pulcheria was. Arcadius reign was marked by the conflict between his wife and the Bishop of Constantinople,“Although his reign (Arcadius) was short, it is remembered in part for the controversial conflicts Eudoxia encountered with John Chrysostom, bishop of Constantinople from 398 to 404.[3] According to the ancient historian Sozomen, in his Ecclesiastical History, Sozomen claims that much of the rivalry was based on an ornate statue made in the honor of Eudoxia which Chrysostom condemned, “The silver statue of the empress...was placed upon a column of porphyry; and the event was celebrated by loud acclamations, dancing, games, and other manifestations of public rejoicing...John declared that these proceedings reflected dishonor on the church.”[4] According to Sozomen, John had also condemned the empress for her grandiose style of ruling over the empire and condemned her in the church, this of course enraged the empress and John was immediately disposed of. Later in life, Pulcheria would bring back the remains of John Chrysostom and make them into relics for the church, in gratitude for his pious life.[5] Eudoxia died in 404 and the emperor Arcadius died in 408. The emperor left behind four young children, including a seven-year-old Theodosius II. Theodosius was made emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire in 408, immediately after his father died. Two praetorian prefects were selected as regents over Theodosius, one being Anthemius and the other, Antiochus; both took over as regent. Eventually Pulcheria herself would take over as regent for her brother.The Emperors Guardian[edit]Once Pulcheria came of age, at fifteen, she felt, like her brother, that her family had no need for Antiochus any longer; her brother dismissed him of his duties. She then became her own brother’s regent: “In 412 Pulcheria quarreled with Antiochus, who like Anthemius had served the dynasty faithfully for a number of years, and induced her brother to dismiss him from the duties of praepositus. She then took personal charge of the imperial family, directing its affairs with such authority that she became known in society at large as the emperor’s guardian.”[6] Immediately when Pulcheria took authority over the imperial palace, the palace took on a much more monastic tone compared to that of her mother’s palace. Sozomen describes Pulcheria’s and her sisters pious ways in his Ecclesiastical History: “They all pursue the same mode of life; they are sedulous in their attendance in the house of prayer, and evince great charity towards strangers and the poor...and pass their days and their nights together in singing the praises of God.”[7] Rituals within the imperial palace also included chanting and reciting passages in the scripture, and fasting twice a week.[6] The sisters were known to have given up luxurious jewelry and apparel worn by most women of the imperial court of the past. Pulcheria also took on the role of providing all the training necessary for Theodosius to become a successful emperor, once he came of age. Although the empire was technically to be ruled by Theodosius II when he would come of age, his older sister Pulcheria exercised such profound influence over him all his life that she must be considered the co-regent of the empire until her death in 453. In fact it can be said without exaggeration that Pulcheria gave the identity to her brothers reign.[8] Pulcherias training of Theodosius included, ...how an Emperor must walk, and ride his horse, alone or in procession; how he should sit upon his throne: how to wear his Imperial armor and robes; and how to speak with dignity. By no means must he yield to loud laughter...[9] Not only did Pulcheria train her brother on the duties and customs of becoming an Emperor, but she also made sure Theodosius was trained to be a pious Christian leader. Once Theodosius came of age to rule as sole Emperor, according to many historians, the teachings of his sister had been ignored. “He was by nature kind, affable, easily led...Not only was he foolishly kind; he was careless, and often he was to neglect his duty in the administration of his Empire.”[10] This lack of power that Theodosius exemplified led to Pulcheria taking on a much larger role of authority and influence in the Empire.Vow of virginity[edit]At the same time Pulcheria proclaimed herself as guardian over her brother she also took a vow of virginity, and her sisters did as well.

Once Theodosius came of age to rule as sole Emperor, according to many historians, the teachings of his sister had been ignored. “He was by nature kind, affable, easily led...Not only was he foolishly kind; he was careless, and often he was to neglect his duty in the administration of his Empire.”[10] This lack of power that Theodosius exemplified led to Pulcheria taking on a much larger role of authority and influence in the Empire.Vow of virginity[edit]At the same time Pulcheria proclaimed herself as guardian over her brother she also took a vow of virginity, and her sisters did as well. Pulcheria’s reason for a vow of virginity may have been her deeply religious virtue as recorded by Sozomen: “She devoted her virginity to God, and instructed her sisters to do likewise. To avoid cause of scandal and opportunities for intrigue, she permitted no man to enter her palace. In confirmation of her resolution she took God, the priests, and all the subjects of the Roman empire as witnesses...”[11] Another contemporary of Pulcheria had also described her deep piety. In a letter from Pope Leo I to Pulcheria, he compliments her on her deeply religious ways: In it you clearly show how much you love the Catholic faith and how much you despise the errors of heretics.[12] Along with being deeply pious, it is possible that Pulcheria may have had other motives to take a vow of virginity. According to ancient historians Sozomen, Socrates, and Theodoret, Pulcheria had a deep dislike for Anthemius, the former guardian of Theodosius;[13] the reasons may have been his distaste for her immense power within the empire and her unwillingness to allow Anthemius to gain power amongst the imperial court. A more recent historian, Kenneth Holum, states that Anthemius had tried to make family ties between himself and the imperial family: “Married long since and many years Pulcheria’s senior, Anthemis naturally proposed a descendent or close relative, a grandson perhaps...born a few years earlier than Pulcheria and an excellent prospect for her hand”[14] Pulcheria had found herself in a position where she would have to give her power up to her potential husband, for once a woman in the imperial court married her power was to be relinquished to her husband. In order for Pulcheria to keep her power within the imperial court she took a vow of virginity to ensure that another man could not share her power.Augusta[edit]In 414 the Roman senate made Pulcheria Augusta. During her time as Augusta, Pulcheria held a great deal of power in politics and although she was a woman was treated equally among other men of power. In the senate of Constantinople lay a bust in her honor along with the other Augusti.[15] Many important events occurred during her time as Augusta and her brothers reign as emperor; however, Pulcheria’s influence was mostly in the church. Pulcheria and her brother were known to have harbored anti Jewish sentiment, and both had started to enact laws against Jewish worship in the city of Constantinople. Before the reign of Theodosius II, synagogues were seen as private property and were protected by the imperial government. In Theodosius’s reign he enacted a law that forbade the construction of synagogues, and demanded the destruction of synagogues as well. Pulcheria and Theodosius also ordered that a group of Jews be killed after strife amongst Christians emerged in Palestine.[16] It was well known that Pulcheria had little respect for Jewish people, stemmed by her disapproval of Nestorian theological practices; Kenneth Holum writes “Pulcheria had long nursed a special hatred for Jews, and the Nestorian heresy, which appeared to contemporaries to be of Jewish origin; no doubt had served to confirm that hatred.”[17] Although Pulcheria was known to have strong feelings against pagans and Jews alike, she was known for her philanthropic spirit as well. She had built many churches in and around the city of Constantinople, she had also built many buildings for the poor in the city Sozomen writes that it would take too much time to describe all the churches Pulcheria built, as well as hospitals and inns for the poor.[18] Pulcherias building projects were so vast in Constantinople that a whole district was named in her honor called the Pulcherianai, Some of these establishments were extensive enough to give the names of their proprietors to entire quarters of the city such as the Marina quarter in the second region and the Pulcherianai in the eleventh.[19] As well as contributing to the city with new churches and districts, Pulcheria contributed significantly to the church by bringing back bishops or remains of bishops who had once been dismissed as relics to the church. Pope Leo I describes Pulcherias contributions to the church in a letter to her, ...the entire Roman Church is most grateful to you for all the works of your faith, whether having assisted envoys in every way with devoted affection and for having brought back the Catholic bishops who were ejected from their churches by an unjust sentence, or for having brought back with fitting honor to the church he governed so well the remains of Flavian of holy memory, an innocent and Catholic bishop.[20] Pulcherias time as Augusta was also marked with war and ongoing conflict with Persia. Pulcheria had inspired war against Persia when Persian King Yazdegerd I executed a Christian bishop who destroyed an Zoroastrian altar.[21] Under the influence of Pulcheria, Theodosius sent troops into battle against Persia, the fanaticism over the war by the people of the empire was described by Sozomen as ready to do anything for the sake of Christianity.[21] Pulcheria and Theodosius were victorious in their invasion of Persia, and according to historians Theodosius had credited his sisters vow of virginity as the reason for victory. Surviving letters identify the source of that victory through the vows of his sisters. In his view, when Pulcheria devoted her virginity to God and imposed the same vow on her sisters, she secured Gods favor, causing every threat and war raised against her brother to disperse spontaneously.[22] Theodosius had made his sisters virginity a tool of war propaganda, and because of her vow to be faithful only to God the hand of God would help Roman troops in battle against Persia. Pulcherias power would become even greater after the death of her brother Theodosius II.Aelia Pulcheria (January 19, 398 or 399 – 453) was the daughter of Eastern Roman Emperor Arcadius and Empress Aelia Eudoxia. She was the second child born to Arcadius and Eudoxia. Her older sister was Flaccilla, who was born in 397 but is assumed to have died young. Her younger siblings were Arcadia, born in 400, Theodosius II, the future emperor, and Marina, both born in 401.[1] When her father Arcadius died in 408, her brother Theodosius II was made Emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire, at seven years old. On July 4, 414 a fifteen-year-old Pulcheria proclaimed herself regent over her brother, then thirteen years of age, and made herself Augusta and Empress of the Eastern Roman Empire. According to the ancient historian Sozomen, in his Ecclesiastical History, Pulcheria took a vow of virginity when she became Augusta, and her sisters followed suit. Theodosius II died on July 26, 450, and Pulcheria soon married Marcian on November 25, 450. Marcian and Pulcheria were proclaimed Emperor and Empress of the Eastern Roman Empire. Three years later, in July 453, Pulcheria died; she was later made a saint by the Church.[2] Pulcheria is known to have held a significant amount of power in her brothers reign as emperor. Pulcheria was also of great influence over the church and theological practices of this time. She had influence over anti-pagan policies, church building projects, and the debate over the Marian title Theotokos (Birth-giver to God).Contents  [hide] 1 Biography1.1 Early life1.2 The Emperors Guardian1.3 Vow of virginity1.4 Augusta1.5 Empress1.5.1 Church conflict1.6 Death2 Relationship with Aelia Eudocia3 Influence over the church4 See also5 Notes6 ReferencesBiography[edit]Early life[edit]Pulcheria was born into the royal House of Theodosius, a dynasty of the later Roman empire, ruling in Constantinople. Her father was Arcadius, and her mother was Aelia Eudoxia. Like Pulcheria, her mother was also powerful and of great influence over the church, however not in the same way Pulcheria was. Arcadius reign was marked by the conflict between his wife and the Bishop of Constantinople,“Although his reign (Arcadius) was short, it is remembered in part for the controversial conflicts Eudoxia encountered with John Chrysostom, bishop of Constantinople from 398 to 404.[3] According to the ancient historian Sozomen, in his Ecclesiastical History, Sozomen claims that much of the rivalry was based on an ornate statue made in the honor of Eudoxia which Chrysostom condemned, “The silver statue of the empress...was placed upon a column of porphyry; and the event was celebrated by loud acclamations, dancing, games, and other manifestations of public rejoicing...John declared that these proceedings reflected dishonor on the church.”[4] According to Sozomen, John had also condemned the empress for her grandiose style of ruling over the empire and condemned her in the church, this of course enraged the empress and John was immediately disposed of. Later in life, Pulcheria would bring back the remains of John Chrysostom and make them into relics for the church, in gratitude for his pious life.[5] Eudoxia died in 404 and the emperor Arcadius died in 408. The emperor left behind four young children, including a seven-year-old Theodosius II. Theodosius was made emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire in 408, immediately after his father died. Two praetorian prefects were selected as regents over Theodosius, one being Anthemius and the other, Antiochus; both took over as regent. Eventually Pulcheria herself would take over as regent for her brother.The Emperors Guardian[edit]Once Pulcheria came of age, at fifteen, she felt, like her brother, that her family had no need for Antiochus any longer; her brother dismissed him of his duties. She then became her own brother’s regent: “In 412 Pulcheria quarreled with Antiochus, who like Anthemius had served the dynasty faithfully for a number of years, and induced her brother to dismiss him from the duties of praepositus. She then took personal charge of the imperial family, directing its affairs with such authority that she became known in society at large as the emperor’s guardian.”[6] Immediately when Pulcheria took authority over the imperial palace, the palace took on a much more monastic tone compared to that of her mother’s palace. Sozomen describes Pulcheria’s and her sisters pious ways in his Ecclesiastical History: “They all pursue the same mode of life; they are sedulous in their attendance in the house of prayer, and evince great charity towards strangers and the poor...and pass their days and their nights together in singing the praises of God.”[7] Rituals within the imperial palace also included chanting and reciting passages in the scripture, and fasting twice a week.[6] The sisters were known to have given up luxurious jewelry and apparel worn by most women of the imperial court of the past. Pulcheria also took on the role of providing all the training necessary for Theodosius to become a successful emperor, once he came of age. Although the empire was technically to be ruled by Theodosius II when he would come of age, his older sister Pulcheria exercised such profound influence over him all his life that she must be considered the co-regent of the empire until her death in 453. In fact it can be said without exaggeration that Pulcheria gave the identity to her brothers reign.[8] Pulcherias training of Theodosius included, ...how an Emperor must walk, and ride his horse, alone or in procession; how he should sit upon his throne: how to wear his Imperial armor and robes; and how to speak with dignity.

In fact it can be said without exaggeration that Pulcheria gave the identity to her brothers reign.[8] Pulcherias training of Theodosius included, ...how an Emperor must walk, and ride his horse, alone or in procession; how he should sit upon his throne: how to wear his Imperial armor and robes; and how to speak with dignity. By no means must he yield to loud laughter...[9] Not only did Pulcheria train her brother on the duties and customs of becoming an Emperor, but she also made sure Theodosius was trained to be a pious Christian leader. Once Theodosius came of age to rule as sole Emperor, according to many historians, the teachings of his sister had been ignored. “He was by nature kind, affable, easily led...Not only was he foolishly kind; he was careless, and often he was to neglect his duty in the administration of his Empire.”[10] This lack of power that Theodosius exemplified led to Pulcheria taking on a much larger role of authority and influence in the Empire.Vow of virginity[edit]At the same time Pulcheria proclaimed herself as guardian over her brother she also took a vow of virginity, and her sisters did as well. Pulcheria’s reason for a vow of virginity may have been her deeply religious virtue as recorded by Sozomen: “She devoted her virginity to God, and instructed her sisters to do likewise. To avoid cause of scandal and opportunities for intrigue, she permitted no man to enter her palace. In confirmation of her resolution she took God, the priests, and all the subjects of the Roman empire as witnesses...”[11] Another contemporary of Pulcheria had also described her deep piety. In a letter from Pope Leo I to Pulcheria, he compliments her on her deeply religious ways: In it you clearly show how much you love the Catholic faith and how much you despise the errors of heretics.[12] Along with being deeply pious, it is possible that Pulcheria may have had other motives to take a vow of virginity. According to ancient historians Sozomen, Socrates, and Theodoret, Pulcheria had a deep dislike for Anthemius, the former guardian of Theodosius;[13] the reasons may have been his distaste for her immense power within the empire and her unwillingness to allow Anthemius to gain power amongst the imperial court. A more recent historian, Kenneth Holum, states that Anthemius had tried to make family ties between himself and the imperial family: “Married long since and many years Pulcheria’s senior, Anthemis naturally proposed a descendent or close relative, a grandson perhaps...born a few years earlier than Pulcheria and an excellent prospect for her hand”[14] Pulcheria had found herself in a position where she would have to give her power up to her potential husband, for once a woman in the imperial court married her power was to be relinquished to her husband. In order for Pulcheria to keep her power within the imperial court she took a vow of virginity to ensure that another man could not share her power.Augusta[edit]In 414 the Roman senate made Pulcheria Augusta. During her time as Augusta, Pulcheria held a great deal of power in politics and although she was a woman was treated equally among other men of power. In the senate of Constantinople lay a bust in her honor along with the other Augusti.[15] Many important events occurred during her time as Augusta and her brothers reign as emperor; however, Pulcheria’s influence was mostly in the church. Pulcheria and her brother were known to have harbored anti Jewish sentiment, and both had started to enact laws against Jewish worship in the city of Constantinople. Before the reign of Theodosius II, synagogues were seen as private property and were protected by the imperial government. In Theodosius’s reign he enacted a law that forbade the construction of synagogues, and demanded the destruction of synagogues as well. Pulcheria and Theodosius also ordered that a group of Jews be killed after strife amongst Christians emerged in Palestine.[16] It was well known that Pulcheria had little respect for Jewish people, stemmed by her disapproval of Nestorian theological practices; Kenneth Holum writes “Pulcheria had long nursed a special hatred for Jews, and the Nestorian heresy, which appeared to contemporaries to be of Jewish origin; no doubt had served to confirm that hatred.”[17] Although Pulcheria was known to have strong feelings against pagans and Jews alike, she was known for her philanthropic spirit as well. She had built many churches in and around the city of Constantinople, she had also built many buildings for the poor in the city Sozomen writes that it would take too much time to describe all the churches Pulcheria built, as well as hospitals and inns for the poor.[18] Pulcherias building projects were so vast in Constantinople that a whole district was named in her honor called the Pulcherianai, Some of these establishments were extensive enough to give the names of their proprietors to entire quarters of the city such as the Marina quarter in the second region and the Pulcherianai in the eleventh.[19] As well as contributing to the city with new churches and districts, Pulcheria contributed significantly to the church by bringing back bishops or remains of bishops who had once been dismissed as relics to the church. Pope Leo I describes Pulcherias contributions to the church in a letter to her, ...the entire Roman Church is most grateful to you for all the works of your faith, whether having assisted envoys in every way with devoted affection and for having brought back the Catholic bishops who were ejected from their churches by an unjust sentence, or for having brought back with fitting honor to the church he governed so well the remains of Flavian of holy memory, an innocent and Catholic bishop.[20] Pulcherias time as Augusta was also marked with war and ongoing conflict with Persia. Pulcheria had inspired war against Persia when Persian King Yazdegerd I executed a Christian bishop who destroyed an Zoroastrian altar.[21] Under the influence of Pulcheria, Theodosius sent troops into battle against Persia, the fanaticism over the war by the people of the empire was described by Sozomen as ready to do anything for the sake of Christianity.[21] Pulcheria and Theodosius were victorious in their invasion of Persia, and according to historians Theodosius had credited his sisters vow of virginity as the reason for victory. Surviving letters identify the source of that victory through the vows of his sisters. In his view, when Pulcheria devoted her virginity to God and imposed the same vow on her sisters, she secured Gods favor, causing every threat and war raised against her brother to disperse spontaneously.[22] Theodosius had made his sisters virginity a tool of war propaganda, and because of her vow to be faithful only to God the hand of God would help Roman troops in battle against Persia. Pulcherias power would become even greater after the death of her brother Theodosius II.Aelia Pulcheria (January 19, 398 or 399 – 453) was the daughter of Eastern Roman Emperor Arcadius and Empress Aelia Eudoxia. She was the second child born to Arcadius and Eudoxia. Her older sister was Flaccilla, who was born in 397 but is assumed to have died young. Her younger siblings were Arcadia, born in 400, Theodosius II, the future emperor, and Marina, both born in 401.[1] When her father Arcadius died in 408, her brother Theodosius II was made Emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire, at seven years old. On July 4, 414 a fifteen-year-old Pulcheria proclaimed herself regent over her brother, then thirteen years of age, and made herself Augusta and Empress of the Eastern Roman Empire. According to the ancient historian Sozomen, in his Ecclesiastical History, Pulcheria took a vow of virginity when she became Augusta, and her sisters followed suit. Theodosius II died on July 26, 450, and Pulcheria soon married Marcian on November 25, 450. Marcian and Pulcheria were proclaimed Emperor and Empress of the Eastern Roman Empire. Three years later, in July 453, Pulcheria died; she was later made a saint by the Church.[2] Pulcheria is known to have held a significant amount of power in her brothers reign as emperor. Pulcheria was also of great influence over the church and theological practices of this time. She had influence over anti-pagan policies, church building projects, and the debate over the Marian title Theotokos (Birth-giver to God).Contents  [hide] 1 Biography1.1 Early life1.2 The Emperors Guardian1.3 Vow of virginity1.4 Augusta1.5 Empress1.5.1 Church conflict1.6 Death2 Relationship with Aelia Eudocia3 Influence over the church4 See also5 Notes6 ReferencesBiography[edit]Early life[edit]Pulcheria was born into the royal House of Theodosius, a dynasty of the later Roman empire, ruling in Constantinople. Her father was Arcadius, and her mother was Aelia Eudoxia. Like Pulcheria, her mother was also powerful and of great influence over the church, however not in the same way Pulcheria was. Arcadius reign was marked by the conflict between his wife and the Bishop of Constantinople,“Although his reign (Arcadius) was short, it is remembered in part for the controversial conflicts Eudoxia encountered with John Chrysostom, bishop of Constantinople from 398 to 404.[3] According to the ancient historian Sozomen, in his Ecclesiastical History, Sozomen claims that much of the rivalry was based on an ornate statue made in the honor of Eudoxia which Chrysostom condemned, “The silver statue of the empress...was placed upon a column of porphyry; and the event was celebrated by loud acclamations, dancing, games, and other manifestations of public rejoicing...John declared that these proceedings reflected dishonor on the church.”[4] According to Sozomen, John had also condemned the empress for her grandiose style of ruling over the empire and condemned her in the church, this of course enraged the empress and John was immediately disposed of. Later in life, Pulcheria would bring back the remains of John Chrysostom and make them into relics for the church, in gratitude for his pious life.[5] Eudoxia died in 404 and the emperor Arcadius died in 408. The emperor left behind four young children, including a seven-year-old Theodosius II. Theodosius was made emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire in 408, immediately after his father died. Two praetorian prefects were selected as regents over Theodosius, one being Anthemius and the other, Antiochus; both took over as regent. Eventually Pulcheria herself would take over as regent for her brother.The Emperors Guardian[edit]Once Pulcheria came of age, at fifteen, she felt, like her brother, that her family had no need for Antiochus any longer; her brother dismissed him of his duties. She then became her own brother’s regent: “In 412 Pulcheria quarreled with Antiochus, who like Anthemius had served the dynasty faithfully for a number of years, and induced her brother to dismiss him from the duties of praepositus. She then took personal charge of the imperial family, directing its affairs with such authority that she became known in society at large as the emperor’s guardian.”[6] Immediately when Pulcheria took authority over the imperial palace, the palace took on a much more monastic tone compared to that of her mother’s palace. Sozomen describes Pulcheria’s and her sisters pious ways in his Ecclesiastical History: “They all pursue the same mode of life; they are sedulous in their attendance in the house of prayer, and evince great charity towards strangers and the poor...and pass their days and their nights together in singing the praises of God.”[7] Rituals within the imperial palace also included chanting and reciting passages in the scripture, and fasting twice a week.[6] The sisters were known to have given up luxurious jewelry and apparel worn by most women of the imperial court of the past. Pulcheria also took on the role of providing all the training necessary for Theodosius to become a successful emperor, once he came of age. Although the empire was technically to be ruled by Theodosius II when he would come of age, his older sister Pulcheria exercised such profound influence over him all his life that she must be considered the co-regent of the empire until her death in 453.

Although the empire was technically to be ruled by Theodosius II when he would come of age, his older sister Pulcheria exercised such profound influence over him all his life that she must be considered the co-regent of the empire until her death in 453. In fact it can be said without exaggeration that Pulcheria gave the identity to her brothers reign.[8] Pulcherias training of Theodosius included, ...how an Emperor must walk, and ride his horse, alone or in procession; how he should sit upon his throne: how to wear his Imperial armor and robes; and how to speak with dignity. By no means must he yield to loud laughter...[9] Not only did Pulcheria train her brother on the duties and customs of becoming an Emperor, but she also made sure Theodosius was trained to be a pious Christian leader. Once Theodosius came of age to rule as sole Emperor, according to many historians, the teachings of his sister had been ignored. “He was by nature kind, affable, easily led...Not only was he foolishly kind; he was careless, and often he was to neglect his duty in the administration of his Empire.”[10] This lack of power that Theodosius exemplified led to Pulcheria taking on a much larger role of authority and influence in the Empire.Vow of virginity[edit]At the same time Pulcheria proclaimed herself as guardian over her brother she also took a vow of virginity, and her sisters did as well. Pulcheria’s reason for a vow of virginity may have been her deeply religious virtue as recorded by Sozomen: “She devoted her virginity to God, and instructed her sisters to do likewise. To avoid cause of scandal and opportunities for intrigue, she permitted no man to enter her palace. In confirmation of her resolution she took God, the priests, and all the subjects of the Roman empire as witnesses...”[11] Another contemporary of Pulcheria had also described her deep piety. In a letter from Pope Leo I to Pulcheria, he compliments her on her deeply religious ways: In it you clearly show how much you love the Catholic faith and how much you despise the errors of heretics.[12] Along with being deeply pious, it is possible that Pulcheria may have had other motives to take a vow of virginity. According to ancient historians Sozomen, Socrates, and Theodoret, Pulcheria had a deep dislike for Anthemius, the former guardian of Theodosius;[13] the reasons may have been his distaste for her immense power within the empire and her unwillingness to allow Anthemius to gain power amongst the imperial court. A more recent historian, Kenneth Holum, states that Anthemius had tried to make family ties between himself and the imperial family: “Married long since and many years Pulcheria’s senior, Anthemis naturally proposed a descendent or close relative, a grandson perhaps...born a few years earlier than Pulcheria and an excellent prospect for her hand”[14] Pulcheria had found herself in a position where she would have to give her power up to her potential husband, for once a woman in the imperial court married her power was to be relinquished to her husband. In order for Pulcheria to keep her power within the imperial court she took a vow of virginity to ensure that another man could not share her power.Augusta[edit]In 414 the Roman senate made Pulcheria Augusta. During her time as Augusta, Pulcheria held a great deal of power in politics and although she was a woman was treated equally among other men of power. In the senate of Constantinople lay a bust in her honor along with the other Augusti.[15] Many important events occurred during her time as Augusta and her brothers reign as emperor; however, Pulcheria’s influence was mostly in the church. Pulcheria and her brother were known to have harbored anti Jewish sentiment, and both had started to enact laws against Jewish worship in the city of Constantinople. Before the reign of Theodosius II, synagogues were seen as private property and were protected by the imperial government. In Theodosius’s reign he enacted a law that forbade the construction of synagogues, and demanded the destruction of synagogues as well. Pulcheria and Theodosius also ordered that a group of Jews be killed after strife amongst Christians emerged in Palestine.[16] It was well known that Pulcheria had little respect for Jewish people, stemmed by her disapproval of Nestorian theological practices; Kenneth Holum writes “Pulcheria had long nursed a special hatred for Jews, and the Nestorian heresy, which appeared to contemporaries to be of Jewish origin; no doubt had served to confirm that hatred.”[17] Although Pulcheria was known to have strong feelings against pagans and Jews alike, she was known for her philanthropic spirit as well. She had built many churches in and around the city of Constantinople, she had also built many buildings for the poor in the city Sozomen writes that it would take too much time to describe all the churches Pulcheria built, as well as hospitals and inns for the poor.[18] Pulcherias building projects were so vast in Constantinople that a whole district was named in her honor called the Pulcherianai, Some of these establishments were extensive enough to give the names of their proprietors to entire quarters of the city such as the Marina quarter in the second region and the Pulcherianai in the eleventh.[19] As well as contributing to the city with new churches and districts, Pulcheria contributed significantly to the church by bringing back bishops or remains of bishops who had once been dismissed as relics to the church. Pope Leo I describes Pulcherias contributions to the church in a letter to her, ...the entire Roman Church is most grateful to you for all the works of your faith, whether having assisted envoys in every way with devoted affection and for having brought back the Catholic bishops who were ejected from their churches by an unjust sentence, or for having brought back with fitting honor to the church he governed so well the remains of Flavian of holy memory, an innocent and Catholic bishop.[20] Pulcherias time as Augusta was also marked with war and ongoing conflict with Persia. Pulcheria had inspired war against Persia when Persian King Yazdegerd I executed a Christian bishop who destroyed an Zoroastrian altar.[21] Under the influence of Pulcheria, Theodosius sent troops into battle against Persia, the fanaticism over the war by the people of the empire was described by Sozomen as ready to do anything for the sake of Christianity.[21] Pulcheria and Theodosius were victorious in their invasion of Persia, and according to historians Theodosius had credited his sisters vow of virginity as the reason for victory. Surviving letters identify the source of that victory through the vows of his sisters. In his view, when Pulcheria devoted her virginity to God and imposed the same vow on her sisters, she secured Gods favor, causing every threat and war raised against her brother to disperse spontaneously.[22] Theodosius had made his sisters virginity a tool of war propaganda, and because of her vow to be faithful only to God the hand of God would help Roman troops in battle against Persia. Pulcherias power would become even greater after the death of her brother Theodosius II.Aelia Pulcheria (January 19, 398 or 399 – 453) was the daughter of Eastern Roman Emperor Arcadius and Empress Aelia Eudoxia. She was the second child born to Arcadius and Eudoxia. Her older sister was Flaccilla, who was born in 397 but is assumed to have died young. Her younger siblings were Arcadia, born in 400, Theodosius II, the future emperor, and Marina, both born in 401.[1] When her father Arcadius died in 408, her brother Theodosius II was made Emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire, at seven years old. On July 4, 414 a fifteen-year-old Pulcheria proclaimed herself regent over her brother, then thirteen years of age, and made herself Augusta and Empress of the Eastern Roman Empire. According to the ancient historian Sozomen, in his Ecclesiastical History, Pulcheria took a vow of virginity when she became Augusta, and her sisters followed suit. Theodosius II died on July 26, 450, and Pulcheria soon married Marcian on November 25, 450. Marcian and Pulcheria were proclaimed Emperor and Empress of the Eastern Roman Empire. Three years later, in July 453, Pulcheria died; she was later made a saint by the Church.[2] Pulcheria is known to have held a significant amount of power in her brothers reign as emperor. Pulcheria was also of great influence over the church and theological practices of this time. She had influence over anti-pagan policies, church building projects, and the debate over the Marian title Theotokos (Birth-giver to God).Contents  [hide] 1 Biography1.1 Early life1.2 The Emperors Guardian1.3 Vow of virginity1.4 Augusta1.5 Empress1.5.1 Church conflict1.6 Death2 Relationship with Aelia Eudocia3 Influence over the church4 See also5 Notes6 ReferencesBiography[edit]Early life[edit]Pulcheria was born into the royal House of Theodosius, a dynasty of the later Roman empire, ruling in Constantinople. Her father was Arcadius, and her mother was Aelia Eudoxia. Like Pulcheria, her mother was also powerful and of great influence over the church, however not in the same way Pulcheria was. Arcadius reign was marked by the conflict between his wife and the Bishop of Constantinople,“Although his reign (Arcadius) was short, it is remembered in part for the controversial conflicts Eudoxia encountered with John Chrysostom, bishop of Constantinople from 398 to 404.[3] According to the ancient historian Sozomen, in his Ecclesiastical History, Sozomen claims that much of the rivalry was based on an ornate statue made in the honor of Eudoxia which Chrysostom condemned, “The silver statue of the empress...was placed upon a column of porphyry; and the event was celebrated by loud acclamations, dancing, games, and other manifestations of public rejoicing...John declared that these proceedings reflected dishonor on the church.”[4] According to Sozomen, John had also condemned the empress for her grandiose style of ruling over the empire and condemned her in the church, this of course enraged the empress and John was immediately disposed of. Later in life, Pulcheria would bring back the remains of John Chrysostom and make them into relics for the church, in gratitude for his pious life.[5] Eudoxia died in 404 and the emperor Arcadius died in 408. The emperor left behind four young children, including a seven-year-old Theodosius II. Theodosius was made emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire in 408, immediately after his father died. Two praetorian prefects were selected as regents over Theodosius, one being Anthemius and the other, Antiochus; both took over as regent. Eventually Pulcheria herself would take over as regent for her brother.The Emperors Guardian[edit]Once Pulcheria came of age, at fifteen, she felt, like her brother, that her family had no need for Antiochus any longer; her brother dismissed him of his duties. She then became her own brother’s regent: “In 412 Pulcheria quarreled with Antiochus, who like Anthemius had served the dynasty faithfully for a number of years, and induced her brother to dismiss him from the duties of praepositus. She then took personal charge of the imperial family, directing its affairs with such authority that she became known in society at large as the emperor’s guardian.”[6] Immediately when Pulcheria took authority over the imperial palace, the palace took on a much more monastic tone compared to that of her mother’s palace. Sozomen describes Pulcheria’s and her sisters pious ways in his Ecclesiastical History: “They all pursue the same mode of life; they are sedulous in their attendance in the house of prayer, and evince great charity towards strangers and the poor...and pass their days and their nights together in singing the praises of God.”[7] Rituals within the imperial palace also included chanting and reciting passages in the scripture, and fasting twice a week.[6] The sisters were known to have given up luxurious jewelry and apparel worn by most women of the imperial court of the past.

Sozomen describes Pulcheria’s and her sisters pious ways in his Ecclesiastical History: “They all pursue the same mode of life; they are sedulous in their attendance in the house of prayer, and evince great charity towards strangers and the poor...and pass their days and their nights together in singing the praises of God.”[7] Rituals within the imperial palace also included chanting and reciting passages in the scripture, and fasting twice a week.[6] The sisters were known to have given up luxurious jewelry and apparel worn by most women of the imperial court of the past. Pulcheria also took on the role of providing all the training necessary for Theodosius to become a successful emperor, once he came of age. Although the empire was technically to be ruled by Theodosius II when he would come of age, his older sister Pulcheria exercised such profound influence over him all his life that she must be considered the co-regent of the empire until her death in 453. In fact it can be said without exaggeration that Pulcheria gave the identity to her brothers reign.[8] Pulcherias training of Theodosius included, ...how an Emperor must walk, and ride his horse, alone or in procession; how he should sit upon his throne: how to wear his Imperial armor and robes; and how to speak with dignity. By no means must he yield to loud laughter...[9] Not only did Pulcheria train her brother on the duties and customs of becoming an Emperor, but she also made sure Theodosius was trained to be a pious Christian leader. Once Theodosius came of age to rule as sole Emperor, according to many historians, the teachings of his sister had been ignored. “He was by nature kind, affable, easily led...Not only was he foolishly kind; he was careless, and often he was to neglect his duty in the administration of his Empire.”[10] This lack of power that Theodosius exemplified led to Pulcheria taking on a much larger role of authority and influence in the Empire.Vow of virginity[edit]At the same time Pulcheria proclaimed herself as guardian over her brother she also took a vow of virginity, and her sisters did as well. Pulcheria’s reason for a vow of virginity may have been her deeply religious virtue as recorded by Sozomen: “She devoted her virginity to God, and instructed her sisters to do likewise. To avoid cause of scandal and opportunities for intrigue, she permitted no man to enter her palace. In confirmation of her resolution she took God, the priests, and all the subjects of the Roman empire as witnesses...”[11] Another contemporary of Pulcheria had also described her deep piety. In a letter from Pope Leo I to Pulcheria, he compliments her on her deeply religious ways: In it you clearly show how much you love the Catholic faith and how much you despise the errors of heretics.[12] Along with being deeply pious, it is possible that Pulcheria may have had other motives to take a vow of virginity. According to ancient historians Sozomen, Socrates, and Theodoret, Pulcheria had a deep dislike for Anthemius, the former guardian of Theodosius;[13] the reasons may have been his distaste for her immense power within the empire and her unwillingness to allow Anthemius to gain power amongst the imperial court. A more recent historian, Kenneth Holum, states that Anthemius had tried to make family ties between himself and the imperial family: “Married long since and many years Pulcheria’s senior, Anthemis naturally proposed a descendent or close relative, a grandson perhaps...born a few years earlier than Pulcheria and an excellent prospect for her hand”[14] Pulcheria had found herself in a position where she would have to give her power up to her potential husband, for once a woman in the imperial court married her power was to be relinquished to her husband. In order for Pulcheria to keep her power within the imperial court she took a vow of virginity to ensure that another man could not share her power.Augusta[edit]In 414 the Roman senate made Pulcheria Augusta. During her time as Augusta, Pulcheria held a great deal of power in politics and although she was a woman was treated equally among other men of power. In the senate of Constantinople lay a bust in her honor along with the other Augusti.[15] Many important events occurred during her time as Augusta and her brothers reign as emperor; however, Pulcheria’s influence was mostly in the church. Pulcheria and her brother were known to have harbored anti Jewish sentiment, and both had started to enact laws against Jewish worship in the city of Constantinople. Before the reign of Theodosius II, synagogues were seen as private property and were protected by the imperial government. In Theodosius’s reign he enacted a law that forbade the construction of synagogues, and demanded the destruction of synagogues as well. Pulcheria and Theodosius also ordered that a group of Jews be killed after strife amongst Christians emerged in Palestine.[16] It was well known that Pulcheria had little respect for Jewish people, stemmed by her disapproval of Nestorian theological practices; Kenneth Holum writes “Pulcheria had long nursed a special hatred for Jews, and the Nestorian heresy, which appeared to contemporaries to be of Jewish origin; no doubt had served to confirm that hatred.”[17] Although Pulcheria was known to have strong feelings against pagans and Jews alike, she was known for her philanthropic spirit as well. She had built many churches in and around the city of Constantinople, she had also built many buildings for the poor in the city Sozomen writes that it would take too much time to describe all the churches Pulcheria built, as well as hospitals and inns for the poor.[18] Pulcherias building projects were so vast in Constantinople that a whole district was named in her honor called the Pulcherianai, Some of these establishments were extensive enough to give the names of their proprietors to entire quarters of the city such as the Marina quarter in the second region and the Pulcherianai in the eleventh.[19] As well as contributing to the city with new churches and districts, Pulcheria contributed significantly to the church by bringing back bishops or remains of bishops who had once been dismissed as relics to the church. Pope Leo I describes Pulcherias contributions to the church in a letter to her, ...the entire Roman Church is most grateful to you for all the works of your faith, whether having assisted envoys in every way with devoted affection and for having brought back the Catholic bishops who were ejected from their churches by an unjust sentence, or for having brought back with fitting honor to the church he governed so well the remains of Flavian of holy memory, an innocent and Catholic bishop.[20] Pulcherias time as Augusta was also marked with war and ongoing conflict with Persia. Pulcheria had inspired war against Persia when Persian King Yazdegerd I executed a Christian bishop who destroyed an Zoroastrian altar.[21] Under the influence of Pulcheria, Theodosius sent troops into battle against Persia, the fanaticism over the war by the people of the empire was described by Sozomen as ready to do anything for the sake of Christianity.[21] Pulcheria and Theodosius were victorious in their invasion of Persia, and according to historians Theodosius had credited his sisters vow of virginity as the reason for victory. Surviving letters identify the source of that victory through the vows of his sisters. In his view, when Pulcheria devoted her virginity to God and imposed the same vow on her sisters, she secured Gods favor, causing every threat and war raised against her brother to disperse spontaneously.[22] Theodosius had made his sisters virginity a tool of war propaganda, and because of her vow to be faithful only to God the hand of God would help Roman troops in battle against Persia. Pulcherias power would become even greater after the death of her brother Theodosius II.Aelia Pulcheria (January 19, 398 or 399 – 453) was the daughter of Eastern Roman Emperor Arcadius and Empress Aelia Eudoxia. She was the second child born to Arcadius and Eudoxia. Her older sister was Flaccilla, who was born in 397 but is assumed to have died young. Her younger siblings were Arcadia, born in 400, Theodosius II, the future emperor, and Marina, both born in 401.[1] When her father Arcadius died in 408, her brother Theodosius II was made Emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire, at seven years old. On July 4, 414 a fifteen-year-old Pulcheria proclaimed herself regent over her brother, then thirteen years of age, and made herself Augusta and Empress of the Eastern Roman Empire. According to the ancient historian Sozomen, in his Ecclesiastical History, Pulcheria took a vow of virginity when she became Augusta, and her sisters followed suit. Theodosius II died on July 26, 450, and Pulcheria soon married Marcian on November 25, 450. Marcian and Pulcheria were proclaimed Emperor and Empress of the Eastern Roman Empire. Three years later, in July 453, Pulcheria died; she was later made a saint by the Church.[2] Pulcheria is known to have held a significant amount of power in her brothers reign as emperor. Pulcheria was also of great influence over the church and theological practices of this time. She had influence over anti-pagan policies, church building projects, and the debate over the Marian title Theotokos (Birth-giver to God).Contents  [hide] 1 Biography1.1 Early life1.2 The Emperors Guardian1.3 Vow of virginity1.4 Augusta1.5 Empress1.5.1 Church conflict1.6 Death2 Relationship with Aelia Eudocia3 Influence over the church4 See also5 Notes6 ReferencesBiography[edit]Early life[edit]Pulcheria was born into the royal House of Theodosius, a dynasty of the later Roman empire, ruling in Constantinople. Her father was Arcadius, and her mother was Aelia Eudoxia. Like Pulcheria, her mother was also powerful and of great influence over the church, however not in the same way Pulcheria was. Arcadius reign was marked by the conflict between his wife and the Bishop of Constantinople,“Although his reign (Arcadius) was short, it is remembered in part for the controversial conflicts Eudoxia encountered with John Chrysostom, bishop of Constantinople from 398 to 404.[3] According to the ancient historian Sozomen, in his Ecclesiastical History, Sozomen claims that much of the rivalry was based on an ornate statue made in the honor of Eudoxia which Chrysostom condemned, “The silver statue of the empress...was placed upon a column of porphyry; and the event was celebrated by loud acclamations, dancing, games, and other manifestations of public rejoicing...John declared that these proceedings reflected dishonor on the church.”[4] According to Sozomen, John had also condemned the empress for her grandiose style of ruling over the empire and condemned her in the church, this of course enraged the empress and John was immediately disposed of. Later in life, Pulcheria would bring back the remains of John Chrysostom and make them into relics for the church, in gratitude for his pious life.[5] Eudoxia died in 404 and the emperor Arcadius died in 408. The emperor left behind four young children, including a seven-year-old Theodosius II. Theodosius was made emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire in 408, immediately after his father died. Two praetorian prefects were selected as regents over Theodosius, one being Anthemius and the other, Antiochus; both took over as regent. Eventually Pulcheria herself would take over as regent for her brother.The Emperors Guardian[edit]Once Pulcheria came of age, at fifteen, she felt, like her brother, that her family had no need for Antiochus any longer; her brother dismissed him of his duties.

She then became her own brother’s regent: “In 412 Pulcheria quarreled with Antiochus, who like Anthemius had served the dynasty faithfully for a number of years, and induced her brother to dismiss him from the duties of praepositus. She then took personal charge of the imperial family, directing its affairs with such authority that she became known in society at large as the emperor’s guardian.”[6] Immediately when Pulcheria took authority over the imperial palace, the palace took on a much more monastic tone compared to that of her mother’s palace. Sozomen describes Pulcheria’s and her sisters pious ways in his Ecclesiastical History: “They all pursue the same mode of life; they are sedulous in their attendance in the house of prayer, and evince great charity towards strangers and the poor...and pass their days and their nights together in singing the praises of God.”[7] Rituals within the imperial palace also included chanting and reciting passages in the scripture, and fasting twice a week.[6] The sisters were known to have given up luxurious jewelry and apparel worn by most women of the imperial court of the past. Pulcheria also took on the role of providing all the training necessary for Theodosius to become a successful emperor, once he came of age. Although the empire was technically to be ruled by Theodosius II when he would come of age, his older sister Pulcheria exercised such profound influence over him all his life that she must be considered the co-regent of the empire until her death in 453. In fact it can be said without exaggeration that Pulcheria gave the identity to her brothers reign.[8] Pulcherias training of Theodosius included, ...how an Emperor must walk, and ride his horse, alone or in procession; how he should sit upon his throne: how to wear his Imperial armor and robes; and how to speak with dignity. By no means must he yield to loud laughter...[9] Not only did Pulcheria train her brother on the duties and customs of becoming an Emperor, but she also made sure Theodosius was trained to be a pious Christian leader. Once Theodosius came of age to rule as sole Emperor, according to many historians, the teachings of his sister had been ignored. “He was by nature kind, affable, easily led...Not only was he foolishly kind; he was careless, and often he was to neglect his duty in the administration of his Empire.”[10] This lack of power that Theodosius exemplified led to Pulcheria taking on a much larger role of authority and influence in the Empire.Vow of virginity[edit]At the same time Pulcheria proclaimed herself as guardian over her brother she also took a vow of virginity, and her sisters did as well. Pulcheria’s reason for a vow of virginity may have been her deeply religious virtue as recorded by Sozomen: “She devoted her virginity to God, and instructed her sisters to do likewise. To avoid cause of scandal and opportunities for intrigue, she permitted no man to enter her palace. In confirmation of her resolution she took God, the priests, and all the subjects of the Roman empire as witnesses...”[11] Another contemporary of Pulcheria had also described her deep piety. In a letter from Pope Leo I to Pulcheria, he compliments her on her deeply religious ways: In it you clearly show how much you love the Catholic faith and how much you despise the errors of heretics.[12] Along with being deeply pious, it is possible that Pulcheria may have had other motives to take a vow of virginity. According to ancient historians Sozomen, Socrates, and Theodoret, Pulcheria had a deep dislike for Anthemius, the former guardian of Theodosius;[13] the reasons may have been his distaste for her immense power within the empire and her unwillingness to allow Anthemius to gain power amongst the imperial court. A more recent historian, Kenneth Holum, states that Anthemius had tried to make family ties between himself and the imperial family: “Married long since and many years Pulcheria’s senior, Anthemis naturally proposed a descendent or close relative, a grandson perhaps...born a few years earlier than Pulcheria and an excellent prospect for her hand”[14] Pulcheria had found herself in a position where she would have to give her power up to her potential husband, for once a woman in the imperial court married her power was to be relinquished to her husband. In order for Pulcheria to keep her power within the imperial court she took a vow of virginity to ensure that another man could not share her power.Augusta[edit]In 414 the Roman senate made Pulcheria Augusta. During her time as Augusta, Pulcheria held a great deal of power in politics and although she was a woman was treated equally among other men of power. In the senate of Constantinople lay a bust in her honor along with the other Augusti.[15] Many important events occurred during her time as Augusta and her brothers reign as emperor; however, Pulcheria’s influence was mostly in the church. Pulcheria and her brother were known to have harbored anti Jewish sentiment, and both had started to enact laws against Jewish worship in the city of Constantinople. Before the reign of Theodosius II, synagogues were seen as private property and were protected by the imperial government. In Theodosius’s reign he enacted a law that forbade the construction of synagogues, and demanded the destruction of synagogues as well. Pulcheria and Theodosius also ordered that a group of Jews be killed after strife amongst Christians emerged in Palestine.[16] It was well known that Pulcheria had little respect for Jewish people, stemmed by her disapproval of Nestorian theological practices; Kenneth Holum writes “Pulcheria had long nursed a special hatred for Jews, and the Nestorian heresy, which appeared to contemporaries to be of Jewish origin; no doubt had served to confirm that hatred.”[17] Although Pulcheria was known to have strong feelings against pagans and Jews alike, she was known for her philanthropic spirit as well. She had built many churches in and around the city of Constantinople, she had also built many buildings for the poor in the city Sozomen writes that it would take too much time to describe all the churches Pulcheria built, as well as hospitals and inns for the poor.[18] Pulcherias building projects were so vast in Constantinople that a whole district was named in her honor called the Pulcherianai, Some of these establishments were extensive enough to give the names of their proprietors to entire quarters of the city such as the Marina quarter in the second region and the Pulcherianai in the eleventh.[19] As well as contributing to the city with new churches and districts, Pulcheria contributed significantly to the church by bringing back bishops or remains of bishops who had once been dismissed as relics to the church. Pope Leo I describes Pulcherias contributions to the church in a letter to her, ...the entire Roman Church is most grateful to you for all the works of your faith, whether having assisted envoys in every way with devoted affection and for having brought back the Catholic bishops who were ejected from their churches by an unjust sentence, or for having brought back with fitting honor to the church he governed so well the remains of Flavian of holy memory, an innocent and Catholic bishop.[20] Pulcherias time as Augusta was also marked with war and ongoing conflict with Persia. Pulcheria had inspired war against Persia when Persian King Yazdegerd I executed a Christian bishop who destroyed an Zoroastrian altar.[21] Under the influence of Pulcheria, Theodosius sent troops into battle against Persia, the fanaticism over the war by the people of the empire was described by Sozomen as ready to do anything for the sake of Christianity.[21] Pulcheria and Theodosius were victorious in their invasion of Persia, and according to historians Theodosius had credited his sisters vow of virginity as the reason for victory. Surviving letters identify the source of that victory through the vows of his sisters. In his view, when Pulcheria devoted her virginity to God and imposed the same vow on her sisters, she secured Gods favor, causing every threat and war raised against her brother to disperse spontaneously.[22] Theodosius had made his sisters virginity a tool of war propaganda, and because of her vow to be faithful only to God the hand of God would help Roman troops in battle against Persia. Pulcherias power would become even greater after the death of her brother Theodosius II.Aelia Pulcheria (January 19, 398 or 399 – 453) was the daughter of Eastern Roman Emperor Arcadius and Empress Aelia Eudoxia. She was the second child born to Arcadius and Eudoxia. Her older sister was Flaccilla, who was born in 397 but is assumed to have died young. Her younger siblings were Arcadia, born in 400, Theodosius II, the future emperor, and Marina, both born in 401.[1] When her father Arcadius died in 408, her brother Theodosius II was made Emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire, at seven years old. On July 4, 414 a fifteen-year-old Pulcheria proclaimed herself regent over her brother, then thirteen years of age, and made herself Augusta and Empress of the Eastern Roman Empire. According to the ancient historian Sozomen, in his Ecclesiastical History, Pulcheria took a vow of virginity when she became Augusta, and her sisters followed suit. Theodosius II died on July 26, 450, and Pulcheria soon married Marcian on November 25, 450. Marcian and Pulcheria were proclaimed Emperor and Empress of the Eastern Roman Empire. Three years later, in July 453, Pulcheria died; she was later made a saint by the Church.[2] Pulcheria is known to have held a significant amount of power in her brothers reign as emperor. Pulcheria was also of great influence over the church and theological practices of this time. She had influence over anti-pagan policies, church building projects, and the debate over the Marian title Theotokos (Birth-giver to God).Contents  [hide] 1 Biography1.1 Early life1.2 The Emperors Guardian1.3 Vow of virginity1.4 Augusta1.5 Empress1.5.1 Church conflict1.6 Death2 Relationship with Aelia Eudocia3 Influence over the church4 See also5 Notes6 ReferencesBiography[edit]Early life[edit]Pulcheria was born into the royal House of Theodosius, a dynasty of the later Roman empire, ruling in Constantinople. Her father was Arcadius, and her mother was Aelia Eudoxia. Like Pulcheria, her mother was also powerful and of great influence over the church, however not in the same way Pulcheria was. Arcadius reign was marked by the conflict between his wife and the Bishop of Constantinople,“Although his reign (Arcadius) was short, it is remembered in part for the controversial conflicts Eudoxia encountered with John Chrysostom, bishop of Constantinople from 398 to 404.[3] According to the ancient historian Sozomen, in his Ecclesiastical History, Sozomen claims that much of the rivalry was based on an ornate statue made in the honor of Eudoxia which Chrysostom condemned, “The silver statue of the empress...was placed upon a column of porphyry; and the event was celebrated by loud acclamations, dancing, games, and other manifestations of public rejoicing...John declared that these proceedings reflected dishonor on the church.”[4] According to Sozomen, John had also condemned the empress for her grandiose style of ruling over the empire and condemned her in the church, this of course enraged the empress and John was immediately disposed of. Later in life, Pulcheria would bring back the remains of John Chrysostom and make them into relics for the church, in gratitude for his pious life.[5] Eudoxia died in 404 and the emperor Arcadius died in 408. The emperor left behind four young children, including a seven-year-old Theodosius II. Theodosius was made emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire in 408, immediately after his father died.

Eventually Pulcheria herself would take over as regent for her brother.The Emperors Guardian[edit]Once Pulcheria came of age, at fifteen, she felt, like her brother, that her family had no need for Antiochus any longer; her brother dismissed him of his duties. She then became her own brother’s regent: “In 412 Pulcheria quarreled with Antiochus, who like Anthemius had served the dynasty faithfully for a number of years, and induced her brother to dismiss him from the duties of praepositus. She then took personal charge of the imperial family, directing its affairs with such authority that she became known in society at large as the emperor’s guardian.”[6] Immediately when Pulcheria took authority over the imperial palace, the palace took on a much more monastic tone compared to that of her mother’s palace. Sozomen describes Pulcheria’s and her sisters pious ways in his Ecclesiastical History: “They all pursue the same mode of life; they are sedulous in their attendance in the house of prayer, and evince great charity towards strangers and the poor...and pass their days and their nights together in singing the praises of God.”[7] Rituals within the imperial palace also included chanting and reciting passages in the scripture, and fasting twice a week.[6] The sisters were known to have given up luxurious jewelry and apparel worn by most women of the imperial court of the past. Pulcheria also took on the role of providing all the training necessary for Theodosius to become a successful emperor, once he came of age. Although the empire was technically to be ruled by Theodosius II when he would come of age, his older sister Pulcheria exercised such profound influence over him all his life that she must be considered the co-regent of the empire until her death in 453. In fact it can be said without exaggeration that Pulcheria gave the identity to her brothers reign.[8] Pulcherias training of Theodosius included, ...how an Emperor must walk, and ride his horse, alone or in procession; how he should sit upon his throne: how to wear his Imperial armor and robes; and how to speak with dignity. By no means must he yield to loud laughter...[9] Not only did Pulcheria train her brother on the duties and customs of becoming an Emperor, but she also made sure Theodosius was trained to be a pious Christian leader. Once Theodosius came of age to rule as sole Emperor, according to many historians, the teachings of his sister had been ignored. “He was by nature kind, affable, easily led...Not only was he foolishly kind; he was careless, and often he was to neglect his duty in the administration of his Empire.”[10] This lack of power that Theodosius exemplified led to Pulcheria taking on a much larger role of authority and influence in the Empire.Vow of virginity[edit]At the same time Pulcheria proclaimed herself as guardian over her brother she also took a vow of virginity, and her sisters did as well. Pulcheria’s reason for a vow of virginity may have been her deeply religious virtue as recorded by Sozomen: “She devoted her virginity to God, and instructed her sisters to do likewise. To avoid cause of scandal and opportunities for intrigue, she permitted no man to enter her palace. In confirmation of her resolution she took God, the priests, and all the subjects of the Roman empire as witnesses...”[11] Another contemporary of Pulcheria had also described her deep piety. In a letter from Pope Leo I to Pulcheria, he compliments her on her deeply religious ways: In it you clearly show how much you love the Catholic faith and how much you despise the errors of heretics.[12] Along with being deeply pious, it is possible that Pulcheria may have had other motives to take a vow of virginity. According to ancient historians Sozomen, Socrates, and Theodoret, Pulcheria had a deep dislike for Anthemius, the former guardian of Theodosius;[13] the reasons may have been his distaste for her immense power within the empire and her unwillingness to allow Anthemius to gain power amongst the imperial court. A more recent historian, Kenneth Holum, states that Anthemius had tried to make family ties between himself and the imperial family: “Married long since and many years Pulcheria’s senior, Anthemis naturally proposed a descendent or close relative, a grandson perhaps...born a few years earlier than Pulcheria and an excellent prospect for her hand”[14] Pulcheria had found herself in a position where she would have to give her power up to her potential husband, for once a woman in the imperial court married her power was to be relinquished to her husband. In order for Pulcheria to keep her power within the imperial court she took a vow of virginity to ensure that another man could not share her power.Augusta[edit]In 414 the Roman senate made Pulcheria Augusta. During her time as Augusta, Pulcheria held a great deal of power in politics and although she was a woman was treated equally among other men of power. In the senate of Constantinople lay a bust in her honor along with the other Augusti.[15] Many important events occurred during her time as Augusta and her brothers reign as emperor; however, Pulcheria’s influence was mostly in the church. Pulcheria and her brother were known to have harbored anti Jewish sentiment, and both had started to enact laws against Jewish worship in the city of Constantinople. Before the reign of Theodosius II, synagogues were seen as private property and were protected by the imperial government. In Theodosius’s reign he enacted a law that forbade the construction of synagogues, and demanded the destruction of synagogues as well. Pulcheria and Theodosius also ordered that a group of Jews be killed after strife amongst Christians emerged in Palestine.[16] It was well known that Pulcheria had little respect for Jewish people, stemmed by her disapproval of Nestorian theological practices; Kenneth Holum writes “Pulcheria had long nursed a special hatred for Jews, and the Nestorian heresy, which appeared to contemporaries to be of Jewish origin; no doubt had served to confirm that hatred.”[17] Although Pulcheria was known to have strong feelings against pagans and Jews alike, she was known for her philanthropic spirit as well. She had built many churches in and around the city of Constantinople, she had also built many buildings for the poor in the city Sozomen writes that it would take too much time to describe all the churches Pulcheria built, as well as hospitals and inns for the poor.[18] Pulcherias building projects were so vast in Constantinople that a whole district was named in her honor called the Pulcherianai, Some of these establishments were extensive enough to give the names of their proprietors to entire quarters of the city such as the Marina quarter in the second region and the Pulcherianai in the eleventh.[19] As well as contributing to the city with new churches and districts, Pulcheria contributed significantly to the church by bringing back bishops or remains of bishops who had once been dismissed as relics to the church. Pope Leo I describes Pulcherias contributions to the church in a letter to her, ...the entire Roman Church is most grateful to you for all the works of your faith, whether having assisted envoys in every way with devoted affection and for having brought back the Catholic bishops who were ejected from their churches by an unjust sentence, or for having brought back with fitting honor to the church he governed so well the remains of Flavian of holy memory, an innocent and Catholic bishop.[20] Pulcherias time as Augusta was also marked with war and ongoing conflict with Persia. Pulcheria had inspired war against Persia when Persian King Yazdegerd I executed a Christian bishop who destroyed an Zoroastrian altar.[21] Under the influence of Pulcheria, Theodosius sent troops into battle against Persia, the fanaticism over the war by the people of the empire was described by Sozomen as ready to do anything for the sake of Christianity.[21] Pulcheria and Theodosius were victorious in their invasion of Persia, and according to historians Theodosius had credited his sisters vow of virginity as the reason for victory. Surviving letters identify the source of that victory through the vows of his sisters. In his view, when Pulcheria devoted her virginity to God and imposed the same vow on her sisters, she secured Gods favor, causing every threat and war raised against her brother to disperse spontaneously.[22] Theodosius had made his sisters virginity a tool of war propaganda, and because of her vow to be faithful only to God the hand of God would help Roman troops in battle against Persia. Pulcherias power would become even greater after the death of her brother Theodosius II.Aelia Pulcheria (January 19, 398 or 399 – 453) was the daughter of Eastern Roman Emperor Arcadius and Empress Aelia Eudoxia. She was the second child born to Arcadius and Eudoxia. Her older sister was Flaccilla, who was born in 397 but is assumed to have died young. Her younger siblings were Arcadia, born in 400, Theodosius II, the future emperor, and Marina, both born in 401.[1] When her father Arcadius died in 408, her brother Theodosius II was made Emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire, at seven years old. On July 4, 414 a fifteen-year-old Pulcheria proclaimed herself regent over her brother, then thirteen years of age, and made herself Augusta and Empress of the Eastern Roman Empire. According to the ancient historian Sozomen, in his Ecclesiastical History, Pulcheria took a vow of virginity when she became Augusta, and her sisters followed suit. Theodosius II died on July 26, 450, and Pulcheria soon married Marcian on November 25, 450. Marcian and Pulcheria were proclaimed Emperor and Empress of the Eastern Roman Empire. Three years later, in July 453, Pulcheria died; she was later made a saint by the Church.[2] Pulcheria is known to have held a significant amount of power in her brothers reign as emperor. Pulcheria was also of great influence over the church and theological practices of this time. She had influence over anti-pagan policies, church building projects, and the debate over the Marian title Theotokos (Birth-giver to God).Contents  [hide] 1 Biography1.1 Early life1.2 The Emperors Guardian1.3 Vow of virginity1.4 Augusta1.5 Empress1.5.1 Church conflict1.6 Death2 Relationship with Aelia Eudocia3 Influence over the church4 See also5 Notes6 ReferencesBiography[edit]Early life[edit]Pulcheria was born into the royal House of Theodosius, a dynasty of the later Roman empire, ruling in Constantinople. Her father was Arcadius, and her mother was Aelia Eudoxia. Like Pulcheria, her mother was also powerful and of great influence over the church, however not in the same way Pulcheria was. Arcadius reign was marked by the conflict between his wife and the Bishop of Constantinople,“Although his reign (Arcadius) was short, it is remembered in part for the controversial conflicts Eudoxia encountered with John Chrysostom, bishop of Constantinople from 398 to 404.[3] According to the ancient historian Sozomen, in his Ecclesiastical History, Sozomen claims that much of the rivalry was based on an ornate statue made in the honor of Eudoxia which Chrysostom condemned, “The silver statue of the empress...was placed upon a column of porphyry; and the event was celebrated by loud acclamations, dancing, games, and other manifestations of public rejoicing...John declared that these proceedings reflected dishonor on the church.”[4] According to Sozomen, John had also condemned the empress for her grandiose style of ruling over the empire and condemned her in the church, this of course enraged the empress and John was immediately disposed of. Later in life, Pulcheria would bring back the remains of John Chrysostom and make them into relics for the church, in gratitude for his pious life.[5] Eudoxia died in 404 and the emperor Arcadius died in 408. The emperor left behind four young children, including a seven-year-old Theodosius II. Theodosius was made emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire in 408, immediately after his father died.

Two praetorian prefects were selected as regents over Theodosius, one being Anthemius and the other, Antiochus; both took over as regent. Eventually Pulcheria herself would take over as regent for her brother.The Emperors Guardian[edit]Once Pulcheria came of age, at fifteen, she felt, like her brother, that her family had no need for Antiochus any longer; her brother dismissed him of his duties. She then became her own brother’s regent: “In 412 Pulcheria quarreled with Antiochus, who like Anthemius had served the dynasty faithfully for a number of years, and induced her brother to dismiss him from the duties of praepositus. She then took personal charge of the imperial family, directing its affairs with such authority that she became known in society at large as the emperor’s guardian.”[6] Immediately when Pulcheria took authority over the imperial palace, the palace took on a much more monastic tone compared to that of her mother’s palace. Sozomen describes Pulcheria’s and her sisters pious ways in his Ecclesiastical History: “They all pursue the same mode of life; they are sedulous in their attendance in the house of prayer, and evince great charity towards strangers and the poor...and pass their days and their nights together in singing the praises of God.”[7] Rituals within the imperial palace also included chanting and reciting passages in the scripture, and fasting twice a week.[6] The sisters were known to have given up luxurious jewelry and apparel worn by most women of the imperial court of the past. Pulcheria also took on the role of providing all the training necessary for Theodosius to become a successful emperor, once he came of age. Although the empire was technically to be ruled by Theodosius II when he would come of age, his older sister Pulcheria exercised such profound influence over him all his life that she must be considered the co-regent of the empire until her death in 453. In fact it can be said without exaggeration that Pulcheria gave the identity to her brothers reign.[8] Pulcherias training of Theodosius included, ...how an Emperor must walk, and ride his horse, alone or in procession; how he should sit upon his throne: how to wear his Imperial armor and robes; and how to speak with dignity. By no means must he yield to loud laughter...[9] Not only did Pulcheria train her brother on the duties and customs of becoming an Emperor, but she also made sure Theodosius was trained to be a pious Christian leader. Once Theodosius came of age to rule as sole Emperor, according to many historians, the teachings of his sister had been ignored. “He was by nature kind, affable, easily led...Not only was he foolishly kind; he was careless, and often he was to neglect his duty in the administration of his Empire.”[10] This lack of power that Theodosius exemplified led to Pulcheria taking on a much larger role of authority and influence in the Empire.Vow of virginity[edit]At the same time Pulcheria proclaimed herself as guardian over her brother she also took a vow of virginity, and her sisters did as well. Pulcheria’s reason for a vow of virginity may have been her deeply religious virtue as recorded by Sozomen: “She devoted her virginity to God, and instructed her sisters to do likewise. To avoid cause of scandal and opportunities for intrigue, she permitted no man to enter her palace. In confirmation of her resolution she took God, the priests, and all the subjects of the Roman empire as witnesses...”[11] Another contemporary of Pulcheria had also described her deep piety. In a letter from Pope Leo I to Pulcheria, he compliments her on her deeply religious ways: In it you clearly show how much you love the Catholic faith and how much you despise the errors of heretics.[12] Along with being deeply pious, it is possible that Pulcheria may have had other motives to take a vow of virginity. According to ancient historians Sozomen, Socrates, and Theodoret, Pulcheria had a deep dislike for Anthemius, the former guardian of Theodosius;[13] the reasons may have been his distaste for her immense power within the empire and her unwillingness to allow Anthemius to gain power amongst the imperial court. A more recent historian, Kenneth Holum, states that Anthemius had tried to make family ties between himself and the imperial family: “Married long since and many years Pulcheria’s senior, Anthemis naturally proposed a descendent or close relative, a grandson perhaps...born a few years earlier than Pulcheria and an excellent prospect for her hand”[14] Pulcheria had found herself in a position where she would have to give her power up to her potential husband, for once a woman in the imperial court married her power was to be relinquished to her husband. In order for Pulcheria to keep her power within the imperial court she took a vow of virginity to ensure that another man could not share her power.Augusta[edit]In 414 the Roman senate made Pulcheria Augusta. During her time as Augusta, Pulcheria held a great deal of power in politics and although she was a woman was treated equally among other men of power. In the senate of Constantinople lay a bust in her honor along with the other Augusti.[15] Many important events occurred during her time as Augusta and her brothers reign as emperor; however, Pulcheria’s influence was mostly in the church. Pulcheria and her brother were known to have harbored anti Jewish sentiment, and both had started to enact laws against Jewish worship in the city of Constantinople. Before the reign of Theodosius II, synagogues were seen as private property and were protected by the imperial government. In Theodosius’s reign he enacted a law that forbade the construction of synagogues, and demanded the destruction of synagogues as well. Pulcheria and Theodosius also ordered that a group of Jews be killed after strife amongst Christians emerged in Palestine.[16] It was well known that Pulcheria had little respect for Jewish people, stemmed by her disapproval of Nestorian theological practices; Kenneth Holum writes “Pulcheria had long nursed a special hatred for Jews, and the Nestorian heresy, which appeared to contemporaries to be of Jewish origin; no doubt had served to confirm that hatred.”[17] Although Pulcheria was known to have strong feelings against pagans and Jews alike, she was known for her philanthropic spirit as well. She had built many churches in and around the city of Constantinople, she had also built many buildings for the poor in the city Sozomen writes that it would take too much time to describe all the churches Pulcheria built, as well as hospitals and inns for the poor.[18] Pulcherias building projects were so vast in Constantinople that a whole district was named in her honor called the Pulcherianai, Some of these establishments were extensive enough to give the names of their proprietors to entire quarters of the city such as the Marina quarter in the second region and the Pulcherianai in the eleventh.[19] As well as contributing to the city with new churches and districts, Pulcheria contributed significantly to the church by bringing back bishops or remains of bishops who had once been dismissed as relics to the church. Pope Leo I describes Pulcherias contributions to the church in a letter to her, ...the entire Roman Church is most grateful to you for all the works of your faith, whether having assisted envoys in every way with devoted affection and for having brought back the Catholic bishops who were ejected from their churches by an unjust sentence, or for having brought back with fitting honor to the church he governed so well the remains of Flavian of holy memory, an innocent and Catholic bishop.[20] Pulcherias time as Augusta was also marked with war and ongoing conflict with Persia. Pulcheria had inspired war against Persia when Persian King Yazdegerd I executed a Christian bishop who destroyed an Zoroastrian altar.[21] Under the influence of Pulcheria, Theodosius sent troops into battle against Persia, the fanaticism over the war by the people of the empire was described by Sozomen as ready to do anything for the sake of Christianity.[21] Pulcheria and Theodosius were victorious in their invasion of Persia, and according to historians Theodosius had credited his sisters vow of virginity as the reason for victory. Surviving letters identify the source of that victory through the vows of his sisters. In his view, when Pulcheria devoted her virginity to God and imposed the same vow on her sisters, she secured Gods favor, causing every threat and war raised against her brother to disperse spontaneously.[22] Theodosius had made his sisters virginity a tool of war propaganda, and because of her vow to be faithful only to God the hand of God would help Roman troops in battle against Persia. Pulcherias power would become even greater after the death of her brother Theodosius II.Aelia Pulcheria (January 19, 398 or 399 – 453) was the daughter of Eastern Roman Emperor Arcadius and Empress Aelia Eudoxia. She was the second child born to Arcadius and Eudoxia. Her older sister was Flaccilla, who was born in 397 but is assumed to have died young. Her younger siblings were Arcadia, born in 400, Theodosius II, the future emperor, and Marina, both born in 401.[1] When her father Arcadius died in 408, her brother Theodosius II was made Emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire, at seven years old. On July 4, 414 a fifteen-year-old Pulcheria proclaimed herself regent over her brother, then thirteen years of age, and made herself Augusta and Empress of the Eastern Roman Empire. According to the ancient historian Sozomen, in his Ecclesiastical History, Pulcheria took a vow of virginity when she became Augusta, and her sisters followed suit. Theodosius II died on July 26, 450, and Pulcheria soon married Marcian on November 25, 450. Marcian and Pulcheria were proclaimed Emperor and Empress of the Eastern Roman Empire. Three years later, in July 453, Pulcheria died; she was later made a saint by the Church.[2] Pulcheria is known to have held a significant amount of power in her brothers reign as emperor. Pulcheria was also of great influence over the church and theological practices of this time. She had influence over anti-pagan policies, church building projects, and the debate over the Marian title Theotokos (Birth-giver to God).Contents  [hide] 1 Biography1.1 Early life1.2 The Emperors Guardian1.3 Vow of virginity1.4 Augusta1.5 Empress1.5.1 Church conflict1.6 Death2 Relationship with Aelia Eudocia3 Influence over the church4 See also5 Notes6 ReferencesBiography[edit]Early life[edit]Pulcheria was born into the royal House of Theodosius, a dynasty of the later Roman empire, ruling in Constantinople. Her father was Arcadius, and her mother was Aelia Eudoxia. Like Pulcheria, her mother was also powerful and of great influence over the church, however not in the same way Pulcheria was. Arcadius reign was marked by the conflict between his wife and the Bishop of Constantinople,“Although his reign (Arcadius) was short, it is remembered in part for the controversial conflicts Eudoxia encountered with John Chrysostom, bishop of Constantinople from 398 to 404.[3] According to the ancient historian Sozomen, in his Ecclesiastical History, Sozomen claims that much of the rivalry was based on an ornate statue made in the honor of Eudoxia which Chrysostom condemned, “The silver statue of the empress...was placed upon a column of porphyry; and the event was celebrated by loud acclamations, dancing, games, and other manifestations of public rejoicing...John declared that these proceedings reflected dishonor on the church.”[4] According to Sozomen, John had also condemned the empress for her grandiose style of ruling over the empire and condemned her in the church, this of course enraged the empress and John was immediately disposed of. Later in life, Pulcheria would bring back the remains of John Chrysostom and make them into relics for the church, in gratitude for his pious life.[5] Eudoxia died in 404 and the emperor Arcadius died in 408.

Later in life, Pulcheria would bring back the remains of John Chrysostom and make them into relics for the church, in gratitude for his pious life.[5] Eudoxia died in 404 and the emperor Arcadius died in 408. The emperor left behind four young children, including a seven-year-old Theodosius II. Theodosius was made emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire in 408, immediately after his father died. Two praetorian prefects were selected as regents over Theodosius, one being Anthemius and the other, Antiochus; both took over as regent. Eventually Pulcheria herself would take over as regent for her brother.The Emperors Guardian[edit]Once Pulcheria came of age, at fifteen, she felt, like her brother, that her family had no need for Antiochus any longer; her brother dismissed him of his duties. She then became her own brother’s regent: “In 412 Pulcheria quarreled with Antiochus, who like Anthemius had served the dynasty faithfully for a number of years, and induced her brother to dismiss him from the duties of praepositus. She then took personal charge of the imperial family, directing its affairs with such authority that she became known in society at large as the emperor’s guardian.”[6] Immediately when Pulcheria took authority over the imperial palace, the palace took on a much more monastic tone compared to that of her mother’s palace. Sozomen describes Pulcheria’s and her sisters pious ways in his Ecclesiastical History: “They all pursue the same mode of life; they are sedulous in their attendance in the house of prayer, and evince great charity towards strangers and the poor...and pass their days and their nights together in singing the praises of God.”[7] Rituals within the imperial palace also included chanting and reciting passages in the scripture, and fasting twice a week.[6] The sisters were known to have given up luxurious jewelry and apparel worn by most women of the imperial court of the past. Pulcheria also took on the role of providing all the training necessary for Theodosius to become a successful emperor, once he came of age. Although the empire was technically to be ruled by Theodosius II when he would come of age, his older sister Pulcheria exercised such profound influence over him all his life that she must be considered the co-regent of the empire until her death in 453. In fact it can be said without exaggeration that Pulcheria gave the identity to her brothers reign.[8] Pulcherias training of Theodosius included, ...how an Emperor must walk, and ride his horse, alone or in procession; how he should sit upon his throne: how to wear his Imperial armor and robes; and how to speak with dignity. By no means must he yield to loud laughter...[9] Not only did Pulcheria train her brother on the duties and customs of becoming an Emperor, but she also made sure Theodosius was trained to be a pious Christian leader. Once Theodosius came of age to rule as sole Emperor, according to many historians, the teachings of his sister had been ignored. “He was by nature kind, affable, easily led...Not only was he foolishly kind; he was careless, and often he was to neglect his duty in the administration of his Empire.”[10] This lack of power that Theodosius exemplified led to Pulcheria taking on a much larger role of authority and influence in the Empire.Vow of virginity[edit]At the same time Pulcheria proclaimed herself as guardian over her brother she also took a vow of virginity, and her sisters did as well. Pulcheria’s reason for a vow of virginity may have been her deeply religious virtue as recorded by Sozomen: “She devoted her virginity to God, and instructed her sisters to do likewise. To avoid cause of scandal and opportunities for intrigue, she permitted no man to enter her palace. In confirmation of her resolution she took God, the priests, and all the subjects of the Roman empire as witnesses...”[11] Another contemporary of Pulcheria had also described her deep piety. In a letter from Pope Leo I to Pulcheria, he compliments her on her deeply religious ways: In it you clearly show how much you love the Catholic faith and how much you despise the errors of heretics.[12] Along with being deeply pious, it is possible that Pulcheria may have had other motives to take a vow of virginity. According to ancient historians Sozomen, Socrates, and Theodoret, Pulcheria had a deep dislike for Anthemius, the former guardian of Theodosius;[13] the reasons may have been his distaste for her immense power within the empire and her unwillingness to allow Anthemius to gain power amongst the imperial court. A more recent historian, Kenneth Holum, states that Anthemius had tried to make family ties between himself and the imperial family: “Married long since and many years Pulcheria’s senior, Anthemis naturally proposed a descendent or close relative, a grandson perhaps...born a few years earlier than Pulcheria and an excellent prospect for her hand”[14] Pulcheria had found herself in a position where she would have to give her power up to her potential husband, for once a woman in the imperial court married her power was to be relinquished to her husband. In order for Pulcheria to keep her power within the imperial court she took a vow of virginity to ensure that another man could not share her power.Augusta[edit]In 414 the Roman senate made Pulcheria Augusta. During her time as Augusta, Pulcheria held a great deal of power in politics and although she was a woman was treated equally among other men of power. In the senate of Constantinople lay a bust in her honor along with the other Augusti.[15] Many important events occurred during her time as Augusta and her brothers reign as emperor; however, Pulcheria’s influence was mostly in the church. Pulcheria and her brother were known to have harbored anti Jewish sentiment, and both had started to enact laws against Jewish worship in the city of Constantinople. Before the reign of Theodosius II, synagogues were seen as private property and were protected by the imperial government. In Theodosius’s reign he enacted a law that forbade the construction of synagogues, and demanded the destruction of synagogues as well. Pulcheria and Theodosius also ordered that a group of Jews be killed after strife amongst Christians emerged in Palestine.[16] It was well known that Pulcheria had little respect for Jewish people, stemmed by her disapproval of Nestorian theological practices; Kenneth Holum writes “Pulcheria had long nursed a special hatred for Jews, and the Nestorian heresy, which appeared to contemporaries to be of Jewish origin; no doubt had served to confirm that hatred.”[17] Although Pulcheria was known to have strong feelings against pagans and Jews alike, she was known for her philanthropic spirit as well. She had built many churches in and around the city of Constantinople, she had also built many buildings for the poor in the city Sozomen writes that it would take too much time to describe all the churches Pulcheria built, as well as hospitals and inns for the poor.[18] Pulcherias building projects were so vast in Constantinople that a whole district was named in her honor called the Pulcherianai, Some of these establishments were extensive enough to give the names of their proprietors to entire quarters of the city such as the Marina quarter in the second region and the Pulcherianai in the eleventh.[19] As well as contributing to the city with new churches and districts, Pulcheria contributed significantly to the church by bringing back bishops or remains of bishops who had once been dismissed as relics to the church. Pope Leo I describes Pulcherias contributions to the church in a letter to her, ...the entire Roman Church is most grateful to you for all the works of your faith, whether having assisted envoys in every way with devoted affection and for having brought back the Catholic bishops who were ejected from their churches by an unjust sentence, or for having brought back with fitting honor to the church he governed so well the remains of Flavian of holy memory, an innocent and Catholic bishop.[20] Pulcherias time as Augusta was also marked with war and ongoing conflict with Persia. Pulcheria had inspired war against Persia when Persian King Yazdegerd I executed a Christian bishop who destroyed an Zoroastrian altar.[21] Under the influence of Pulcheria, Theodosius sent troops into battle against Persia, the fanaticism over the war by the people of the empire was described by Sozomen as ready to do anything for the sake of Christianity.[21] Pulcheria and Theodosius were victorious in their invasion of Persia, and according to historians Theodosius had credited his sisters vow of virginity as the reason for victory. Surviving letters identify the source of that victory through the vows of his sisters. In his view, when Pulcheria devoted her virginity to God and imposed the same vow on her sisters, she secured Gods favor, causing every threat and war raised against her brother to disperse spontaneously.[22] Theodosius had made his sisters virginity a tool of war propaganda, and because of her vow to be faithful only to God the hand of God would help Roman troops in battle against Persia. Pulcherias power would become even greater after the death of her brother Theodosius II.Aelia Pulcheria (January 19, 398 or 399 – 453) was the daughter of Eastern Roman Emperor Arcadius and Empress Aelia Eudoxia. She was the second child born to Arcadius and Eudoxia. Her older sister was Flaccilla, who was born in 397 but is assumed to have died young. Her younger siblings were Arcadia, born in 400, Theodosius II, the future emperor, and Marina, both born in 401.[1] When her father Arcadius died in 408, her brother Theodosius II was made Emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire, at seven years old. On July 4, 414 a fifteen-year-old Pulcheria proclaimed herself regent over her brother, then thirteen years of age, and made herself Augusta and Empress of the Eastern Roman Empire. According to the ancient historian Sozomen, in his Ecclesiastical History, Pulcheria took a vow of virginity when she became Augusta, and her sisters followed suit. Theodosius II died on July 26, 450, and Pulcheria soon married Marcian on November 25, 450. Marcian and Pulcheria were proclaimed Emperor and Empress of the Eastern Roman Empire. Three years later, in July 453, Pulcheria died; she was later made a saint by the Church.[2] Pulcheria is known to have held a significant amount of power in her brothers reign as emperor. Pulcheria was also of great influence over the church and theological practices of this time. She had influence over anti-pagan policies, church building projects, and the debate over the Marian title Theotokos (Birth-giver to God).Contents  [hide] 1 Biography1.1 Early life1.2 The Emperors Guardian1.3 Vow of virginity1.4 Augusta1.5 Empress1.5.1 Church conflict1.6 Death2 Relationship with Aelia Eudocia3 Influence over the church4 See also5 Notes6 ReferencesBiography[edit]Early life[edit]Pulcheria was born into the royal House of Theodosius, a dynasty of the later Roman empire, ruling in Constantinople.

Arcadius reign was marked by the conflict between his wife and the Bishop of Constantinople,“Although his reign (Arcadius) was short, it is remembered in part for the controversial conflicts Eudoxia encountered with John Chrysostom, bishop of Constantinople from 398 to 404.[3] According to the ancient historian Sozomen, in his Ecclesiastical History, Sozomen claims that much of the rivalry was based on an ornate statue made in the honor of Eudoxia which Chrysostom condemned, “The silver statue of the empress...was placed upon a column of porphyry; and the event was celebrated by loud acclamations, dancing, games, and other manifestations of public rejoicing...John declared that these proceedings reflected dishonor on the church.”[4] According to Sozomen, John had also condemned the empress for her grandiose style of ruling over the empire and condemned her in the church, this of course enraged the empress and John was immediately disposed of. Later in life, Pulcheria would bring back the remains of John Chrysostom and make them into relics for the church, in gratitude for his pious life.[5] Eudoxia died in 404 and the emperor Arcadius died in 408. The emperor left behind four young children, including a seven-year-old Theodosius II. Theodosius was made emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire in 408, immediately after his father died. Two praetorian prefects were selected as regents over Theodosius, one being Anthemius and the other, Antiochus; both took over as regent. Eventually Pulcheria herself would take over as regent for her brother.The Emperors Guardian[edit]Once Pulcheria came of age, at fifteen, she felt, like her brother, that her family had no need for Antiochus any longer; her brother dismissed him of his duties. She then became her own brother’s regent: “In 412 Pulcheria quarreled with Antiochus, who like Anthemius had served the dynasty faithfully for a number of years, and induced her brother to dismiss him from the duties of praepositus. She then took personal charge of the imperial family, directing its affairs with such authority that she became known in society at large as the emperor’s guardian.”[6] Immediately when Pulcheria took authority over the imperial palace, the palace took on a much more monastic tone compared to that of her mother’s palace. Sozomen describes Pulcheria’s and her sisters pious ways in his Ecclesiastical History: “They all pursue the same mode of life; they are sedulous in their attendance in the house of prayer, and evince great charity towards strangers and the poor...and pass their days and their nights together in singing the praises of God.”[7] Rituals within the imperial palace also included chanting and reciting passages in the scripture, and fasting twice a week.[6] The sisters were known to have given up luxurious jewelry and apparel worn by most women of the imperial court of the past. Pulcheria also took on the role of providing all the training necessary for Theodosius to become a successful emperor, once he came of age. Although the empire was technically to be ruled by Theodosius II when he would come of age, his older sister Pulcheria exercised such profound influence over him all his life that she must be considered the co-regent of the empire until her death in 453. In fact it can be said without exaggeration that Pulcheria gave the identity to her brothers reign.[8] Pulcherias training of Theodosius included, ...how an Emperor must walk, and ride his horse, alone or in procession; how he should sit upon his throne: how to wear his Imperial armor and robes; and how to speak with dignity. By no means must he yield to loud laughter...[9] Not only did Pulcheria train her brother on the duties and customs of becoming an Emperor, but she also made sure Theodosius was trained to be a pious Christian leader. Once Theodosius came of age to rule as sole Emperor, according to many historians, the teachings of his sister had been ignored. “He was by nature kind, affable, easily led...Not only was he foolishly kind; he was careless, and often he was to neglect his duty in the administration of his Empire.”[10] This lack of power that Theodosius exemplified led to Pulcheria taking on a much larger role of authority and influence in the Empire.Vow of virginity[edit]At the same time Pulcheria proclaimed herself as guardian over her brother she also took a vow of virginity, and her sisters did as well. Pulcheria’s reason for a vow of virginity may have been her deeply religious virtue as recorded by Sozomen: “She devoted her virginity to God, and instructed her sisters to do likewise. To avoid cause of scandal and opportunities for intrigue, she permitted no man to enter her palace. In confirmation of her resolution she took God, the priests, and all the subjects of the Roman empire as witnesses...”[11] Another contemporary of Pulcheria had also described her deep piety. In a letter from Pope Leo I to Pulcheria, he compliments her on her deeply religious ways: In it you clearly show how much you love the Catholic faith and how much you despise the errors of heretics.[12] Along with being deeply pious, it is possible that Pulcheria may have had other motives to take a vow of virginity. According to ancient historians Sozomen, Socrates, and Theodoret, Pulcheria had a deep dislike for Anthemius, the former guardian of Theodosius;[13] the reasons may have been his distaste for her immense power within the empire and her unwillingness to allow Anthemius to gain power amongst the imperial court. A more recent historian, Kenneth Holum, states that Anthemius had tried to make family ties between himself and the imperial family: “Married long since and many years Pulcheria’s senior, Anthemis naturally proposed a descendent or close relative, a grandson perhaps...born a few years earlier than Pulcheria and an excellent prospect for her hand”[14] Pulcheria had found herself in a position where she would have to give her power up to her potential husband, for once a woman in the imperial court married her power was to be relinquished to her husband. In order for Pulcheria to keep her power within the imperial court she took a vow of virginity to ensure that another man could not share her power.Augusta[edit]In 414 the Roman senate made Pulcheria Augusta. During her time as Augusta, Pulcheria held a great deal of power in politics and although she was a woman was treated equally among other men of power. In the senate of Constantinople lay a bust in her honor along with the other Augusti.[15] Many important events occurred during her time as Augusta and her brothers reign as emperor; however, Pulcheria’s influence was mostly in the church. Pulcheria and her brother were known to have harbored anti Jewish sentiment, and both had started to enact laws against Jewish worship in the city of Constantinople. Before the reign of Theodosius II, synagogues were seen as private property and were protected by the imperial government. In Theodosius’s reign he enacted a law that forbade the construction of synagogues, and demanded the destruction of synagogues as well. Pulcheria and Theodosius also ordered that a group of Jews be killed after strife amongst Christians emerged in Palestine.[16] It was well known that Pulcheria had little respect for Jewish people, stemmed by her disapproval of Nestorian theological practices; Kenneth Holum writes “Pulcheria had long nursed a special hatred for Jews, and the Nestorian heresy, which appeared to contemporaries to be of Jewish origin; no doubt had served to confirm that hatred.”[17] Although Pulcheria was known to have strong feelings against pagans and Jews alike, she was known for her philanthropic spirit as well. She had built many churches in and around the city of Constantinople, she had also built many buildings for the poor in the city Sozomen writes that it would take too much time to describe all the churches Pulcheria built, as well as hospitals and inns for the poor.[18] Pulcherias building projects were so vast in Constantinople that a whole district was named in her honor called the Pulcherianai, Some of these establishments were extensive enough to give the names of their proprietors to entire quarters of the city such as the Marina quarter in the second region and the Pulcherianai in the eleventh.[19] As well as contributing to the city with new churches and districts, Pulcheria contributed significantly to the church by bringing back bishops or remains of bishops who had once been dismissed as relics to the church. Pope Leo I describes Pulcherias contributions to the church in a letter to her, ...the entire Roman Church is most grateful to you for all the works of your faith, whether having assisted envoys in every way with devoted affection and for having brought back the Catholic bishops who were ejected from their churches by an unjust sentence, or for having brought back with fitting honor to the church he governed so well the remains of Flavian of holy memory, an innocent and Catholic bishop.[20] Pulcherias time as Augusta was also marked with war and ongoing conflict with Persia. Pulcheria had inspired war against Persia when Persian King Yazdegerd I executed a Christian bishop who destroyed an Zoroastrian altar.[21] Under the influence of Pulcheria, Theodosius sent troops into battle against Persia, the fanaticism over the war by the people of the empire was described by Sozomen as ready to do anything for the sake of Christianity.[21] Pulcheria and Theodosius were victorious in their invasion of Persia, and according to historians Theodosius had credited his sisters vow of virginity as the reason for victory. Surviving letters identify the source of that victory through the vows of his sisters. In his view, when Pulcheria devoted her virginity to God and imposed the same vow on her sisters, she secured Gods favor, causing every threat and war raised against her brother to disperse spontaneously.[22] Theodosius had made his sisters virginity a tool of war propaganda, and because of her vow to be faithful only to God the hand of God would help Roman troops in battle against Persia. Pulcherias power would become even greater after the death of her brother Theodosius II.Aelia Pulcheria (January 19, 398 or 399 – 453) was the daughter of Eastern Roman Emperor Arcadius and Empress Aelia Eudoxia. She was the second child born to Arcadius and Eudoxia. Her older sister was Flaccilla, who was born in 397 but is assumed to have died young. Her younger siblings were Arcadia, born in 400, Theodosius II, the future emperor, and Marina, both born in 401.[1] When her father Arcadius died in 408, her brother Theodosius II was made Emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire, at seven years old. On July 4, 414 a fifteen-year-old Pulcheria proclaimed herself regent over her brother, then thirteen years of age, and made herself Augusta and Empress of the Eastern Roman Empire. According to the ancient historian Sozomen, in his Ecclesiastical History, Pulcheria took a vow of virginity when she became Augusta, and her sisters followed suit. Theodosius II died on July 26, 450, and Pulcheria soon married Marcian on November 25, 450. Marcian and Pulcheria were proclaimed Emperor and Empress of the Eastern Roman Empire. Three years later, in July 453, Pulcheria died; she was later made a saint by the Church.[2] Pulcheria is known to have held a significant amount of power in her brothers reign as emperor. Pulcheria was also of great influence over the church and theological practices of this time.

She had influence over anti-pagan policies, church building projects, and the debate over the Marian title Theotokos (Birth-giver to God).Contents  [hide] 1 Biography1.1 Early life1.2 The Emperors Guardian1.3 Vow of virginity1.4 Augusta1.5 Empress1.5.1 Church conflict1.6 Death2 Relationship with Aelia Eudocia3 Influence over the church4 See also5 Notes6 ReferencesBiography[edit]Early life[edit]Pulcheria was born into the royal House of Theodosius, a dynasty of the later Roman empire, ruling in Constantinople. Her father was Arcadius, and her mother was Aelia Eudoxia. Like Pulcheria, her mother was also powerful and of great influence over the church, however not in the same way Pulcheria was. Arcadius reign was marked by the conflict between his wife and the Bishop of Constantinople,“Although his reign (Arcadius) was short, it is remembered in part for the controversial conflicts Eudoxia encountered with John Chrysostom, bishop of Constantinople from 398 to 404.[3] According to the ancient historian Sozomen, in his Ecclesiastical History, Sozomen claims that much of the rivalry was based on an ornate statue made in the honor of Eudoxia which Chrysostom condemned, “The silver statue of the empress...was placed upon a column of porphyry; and the event was celebrated by loud acclamations, dancing, games, and other manifestations of public rejoicing...John declared that these proceedings reflected dishonor on the church.”[4] According to Sozomen, John had also condemned the empress for her grandiose style of ruling over the empire and condemned her in the church, this of course enraged the empress and John was immediately disposed of. Later in life, Pulcheria would bring back the remains of John Chrysostom and make them into relics for the church, in gratitude for his pious life.[5] Eudoxia died in 404 and the emperor Arcadius died in 408. The emperor left behind four young children, including a seven-year-old Theodosius II. Theodosius was made emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire in 408, immediately after his father died. Two praetorian prefects were selected as regents over Theodosius, one being Anthemius and the other, Antiochus; both took over as regent. Eventually Pulcheria herself would take over as regent for her brother.The Emperors Guardian[edit]Once Pulcheria came of age, at fifteen, she felt, like her brother, that her family had no need for Antiochus any longer; her brother dismissed him of his duties. She then became her own brother’s regent: “In 412 Pulcheria quarreled with Antiochus, who like Anthemius had served the dynasty faithfully for a number of years, and induced her brother to dismiss him from the duties of praepositus. She then took personal charge of the imperial family, directing its affairs with such authority that she became known in society at large as the emperor’s guardian.”[6] Immediately when Pulcheria took authority over the imperial palace, the palace took on a much more monastic tone compared to that of her mother’s palace. Sozomen describes Pulcheria’s and her sisters pious ways in his Ecclesiastical History: “They all pursue the same mode of life; they are sedulous in their attendance in the house of prayer, and evince great charity towards strangers and the poor...and pass their days and their nights together in singing the praises of God.”[7] Rituals within the imperial palace also included chanting and reciting passages in the scripture, and fasting twice a week.[6] The sisters were known to have given up luxurious jewelry and apparel worn by most women of the imperial court of the past. Pulcheria also took on the role of providing all the training necessary for Theodosius to become a successful emperor, once he came of age. Although the empire was technically to be ruled by Theodosius II when he would come of age, his older sister Pulcheria exercised such profound influence over him all his life that she must be considered the co-regent of the empire until her death in 453. In fact it can be said without exaggeration that Pulcheria gave the identity to her brothers reign.[8] Pulcherias training of Theodosius included, ...how an Emperor must walk, and ride his horse, alone or in procession; how he should sit upon his throne: how to wear his Imperial armor and robes; and how to speak with dignity. By no means must he yield to loud laughter...[9] Not only did Pulcheria train her brother on the duties and customs of becoming an Emperor, but she also made sure Theodosius was trained to be a pious Christian leader. Once Theodosius came of age to rule as sole Emperor, according to many historians, the teachings of his sister had been ignored. “He was by nature kind, affable, easily led...Not only was he foolishly kind; he was careless, and often he was to neglect his duty in the administration of his Empire.”[10] This lack of power that Theodosius exemplified led to Pulcheria taking on a much larger role of authority and influence in the Empire.Vow of virginity[edit]At the same time Pulcheria proclaimed herself as guardian over her brother she also took a vow of virginity, and her sisters did as well. Pulcheria’s reason for a vow of virginity may have been her deeply religious virtue as recorded by Sozomen: “She devoted her virginity to God, and instructed her sisters to do likewise. To avoid cause of scandal and opportunities for intrigue, she permitted no man to enter her palace. In confirmation of her resolution she took God, the priests, and all the subjects of the Roman empire as witnesses...”[11] Another contemporary of Pulcheria had also described her deep piety. In a letter from Pope Leo I to Pulcheria, he compliments her on her deeply religious ways: In it you clearly show how much you love the Catholic faith and how much you despise the errors of heretics.[12] Along with being deeply pious, it is possible that Pulcheria may have had other motives to take a vow of virginity. According to ancient historians Sozomen, Socrates, and Theodoret, Pulcheria had a deep dislike for Anthemius, the former guardian of Theodosius;[13] the reasons may have been his distaste for her immense power within the empire and her unwillingness to allow Anthemius to gain power amongst the imperial court. A more recent historian, Kenneth Holum, states that Anthemius had tried to make family ties between himself and the imperial family: “Married long since and many years Pulcheria’s senior, Anthemis naturally proposed a descendent or close relative, a grandson perhaps...born a few years earlier than Pulcheria and an excellent prospect for her hand”[14] Pulcheria had found herself in a position where she would have to give her power up to her potential husband, for once a woman in the imperial court married her power was to be relinquished to her husband. In order for Pulcheria to keep her power within the imperial court she took a vow of virginity to ensure that another man could not share her power.Augusta[edit]In 414 the Roman senate made Pulcheria Augusta. During her time as Augusta, Pulcheria held a great deal of power in politics and although she was a woman was treated equally among other men of power. In the senate of Constantinople lay a bust in her honor along with the other Augusti.[15] Many important events occurred during her time as Augusta and her brothers reign as emperor; however, Pulcheria’s influence was mostly in the church. Pulcheria and her brother were known to have harbored anti Jewish sentiment, and both had started to enact laws against Jewish worship in the city of Constantinople. Before the reign of Theodosius II, synagogues were seen as private property and were protected by the imperial government. In Theodosius’s reign he enacted a law that forbade the construction of synagogues, and demanded the destruction of synagogues as well. Pulcheria and Theodosius also ordered that a group of Jews be killed after strife amongst Christians emerged in Palestine.[16] It was well known that Pulcheria had little respect for Jewish people, stemmed by her disapproval of Nestorian theological practices; Kenneth Holum writes “Pulcheria had long nursed a special hatred for Jews, and the Nestorian heresy, which appeared to contemporaries to be of Jewish origin; no doubt had served to confirm that hatred.”[17] Although Pulcheria was known to have strong feelings against pagans and Jews alike, she was known for her philanthropic spirit as well. She had built many churches in and around the city of Constantinople, she had also built many buildings for the poor in the city Sozomen writes that it would take too much time to describe all the churches Pulcheria built, as well as hospitals and inns for the poor.[18] Pulcherias building projects were so vast in Constantinople that a whole district was named in her honor called the Pulcherianai, Some of these establishments were extensive enough to give the names of their proprietors to entire quarters of the city such as the Marina quarter in the second region and the Pulcherianai in the eleventh.[19] As well as contributing to the city with new churches and districts, Pulcheria contributed significantly to the church by bringing back bishops or remains of bishops who had once been dismissed as relics to the church. Pope Leo I describes Pulcherias contributions to the church in a letter to her, ...the entire Roman Church is most grateful to you for all the works of your faith, whether having assisted envoys in every way with devoted affection and for having brought back the Catholic bishops who were ejected from their churches by an unjust sentence, or for having brought back with fitting honor to the church he governed so well the remains of Flavian of holy memory, an innocent and Catholic bishop.[20] Pulcherias time as Augusta was also marked with war and ongoing conflict with Persia. Pulcheria had inspired war against Persia when Persian King Yazdegerd I executed a Christian bishop who destroyed an Zoroastrian altar.[21] Under the influence of Pulcheria, Theodosius sent troops into battle against Persia, the fanaticism over the war by the people of the empire was described by Sozomen as ready to do anything for the sake of Christianity.[21] Pulcheria and Theodosius were victorious in their invasion of Persia, and according to historians Theodosius had credited his sisters vow of virginity as the reason for victory. Surviving letters identify the source of that victory through the vows of his sisters. In his view, when Pulcheria devoted her virginity to God and imposed the same vow on her sisters, she secured Gods favor, causing every threat and war raised against her brother to disperse spontaneously.[22] Theodosius had made his sisters virginity a tool of war propaganda, and because of her vow to be faithful only to God the hand of God would help Roman troops in battle against Persia. Pulcherias power would become even greater after the death of her brother Theodosius II.Aelia Pulcheria (January 19, 398 or 399 – 453) was the daughter of Eastern Roman Emperor Arcadius and Empress Aelia Eudoxia. She was the second child born to Arcadius and Eudoxia. Her older sister was Flaccilla, who was born in 397 but is assumed to have died young. Her younger siblings were Arcadia, born in 400, Theodosius II, the future emperor, and Marina, both born in 401.[1] When her father Arcadius died in 408, her brother Theodosius II was made Emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire, at seven years old. On July 4, 414 a fifteen-year-old Pulcheria proclaimed herself regent over her brother, then thirteen years of age, and made herself Augusta and Empress of the Eastern Roman Empire. According to the ancient historian Sozomen, in his Ecclesiastical History, Pulcheria took a vow of virginity when she became Augusta, and her sisters followed suit. Theodosius II died on July 26, 450, and Pulcheria soon married Marcian on November 25, 450. Marcian and Pulcheria were proclaimed Emperor and Empress of the Eastern Roman Empire. Three years later, in July 453, Pulcheria died; she was later made a saint by the Church.[2] Pulcheria is known to have held a significant amount of power in her brothers reign as emperor.

Pulcheria was also of great influence over the church and theological practices of this time. She had influence over anti-pagan policies, church building projects, and the debate over the Marian title Theotokos (Birth-giver to God).Contents  [hide] 1 Biography1.1 Early life1.2 The Emperors Guardian1.3 Vow of virginity1.4 Augusta1.5 Empress1.5.1 Church conflict1.6 Death2 Relationship with Aelia Eudocia3 Influence over the church4 See also5 Notes6 ReferencesBiography[edit]Early life[edit]Pulcheria was born into the royal House of Theodosius, a dynasty of the later Roman empire, ruling in Constantinople. Her father was Arcadius, and her mother was Aelia Eudoxia. Like Pulcheria, her mother was also powerful and of great influence over the church, however not in the same way Pulcheria was. Arcadius reign was marked by the conflict between his wife and the Bishop of Constantinople,“Although his reign (Arcadius) was short, it is remembered in part for the controversial conflicts Eudoxia encountered with John Chrysostom, bishop of Constantinople from 398 to 404.[3] According to the ancient historian Sozomen, in his Ecclesiastical History, Sozomen claims that much of the rivalry was based on an ornate statue made in the honor of Eudoxia which Chrysostom condemned, “The silver statue of the empress...was placed upon a column of porphyry; and the event was celebrated by loud acclamations, dancing, games, and other manifestations of public rejoicing...John declared that these proceedings reflected dishonor on the church.”[4] According to Sozomen, John had also condemned the empress for her grandiose style of ruling over the empire and condemned her in the church, this of course enraged the empress and John was immediately disposed of. Later in life, Pulcheria would bring back the remains of John Chrysostom and make them into relics for the church, in gratitude for his pious life.[5] Eudoxia died in 404 and the emperor Arcadius died in 408. The emperor left behind four young children, including a seven-year-old Theodosius II. Theodosius was made emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire in 408, immediately after his father died. Two praetorian prefects were selected as regents over Theodosius, one being Anthemius and the other, Antiochus; both took over as regent. Eventually Pulcheria herself would take over as regent for her brother.The Emperors Guardian[edit]Once Pulcheria came of age, at fifteen, she felt, like her brother, that her family had no need for Antiochus any longer; her brother dismissed him of his duties. She then became her own brother’s regent: “In 412 Pulcheria quarreled with Antiochus, who like Anthemius had served the dynasty faithfully for a number of years, and induced her brother to dismiss him from the duties of praepositus. She then took personal charge of the imperial family, directing its affairs with such authority that she became known in society at large as the emperor’s guardian.”[6] Immediately when Pulcheria took authority over the imperial palace, the palace took on a much more monastic tone compared to that of her mother’s palace. Sozomen describes Pulcheria’s and her sisters pious ways in his Ecclesiastical History: “They all pursue the same mode of life; they are sedulous in their attendance in the house of prayer, and evince great charity towards strangers and the poor...and pass their days and their nights together in singing the praises of God.”[7] Rituals within the imperial palace also included chanting and reciting passages in the scripture, and fasting twice a week.[6] The sisters were known to have given up luxurious jewelry and apparel worn by most women of the imperial court of the past. Pulcheria also took on the role of providing all the training necessary for Theodosius to become a successful emperor, once he came of age. Although the empire was technically to be ruled by Theodosius II when he would come of age, his older sister Pulcheria exercised such profound influence over him all his life that she must be considered the co-regent of the empire until her death in 453. In fact it can be said without exaggeration that Pulcheria gave the identity to her brothers reign.[8] Pulcherias training of Theodosius included, ...how an Emperor must walk, and ride his horse, alone or in procession; how he should sit upon his throne: how to wear his Imperial armor and robes; and how to speak with dignity. By no means must he yield to loud laughter...[9] Not only did Pulcheria train her brother on the duties and customs of becoming an Emperor, but she also made sure Theodosius was trained to be a pious Christian leader. Once Theodosius came of age to rule as sole Emperor, according to many historians, the teachings of his sister had been ignored. “He was by nature kind, affable, easily led...Not only was he foolishly kind; he was careless, and often he was to neglect his duty in the administration of his Empire.”[10] This lack of power that Theodosius exemplified led to Pulcheria taking on a much larger role of authority and influence in the Empire.Vow of virginity[edit]At the same time Pulcheria proclaimed herself as guardian over her brother she also took a vow of virginity, and her sisters did as well. Pulcheria’s reason for a vow of virginity may have been her deeply religious virtue as recorded by Sozomen: “She devoted her virginity to God, and instructed her sisters to do likewise. To avoid cause of scandal and opportunities for intrigue, she permitted no man to enter her palace. In confirmation of her resolution she took God, the priests, and all the subjects of the Roman empire as witnesses...”[11] Another contemporary of Pulcheria had also described her deep piety. In a letter from Pope Leo I to Pulcheria, he compliments her on her deeply religious ways: In it you clearly show how much you love the Catholic faith and how much you despise the errors of heretics.[12] Along with being deeply pious, it is possible that Pulcheria may have had other motives to take a vow of virginity. According to ancient historians Sozomen, Socrates, and Theodoret, Pulcheria had a deep dislike for Anthemius, the former guardian of Theodosius;[13] the reasons may have been his distaste for her immense power within the empire and her unwillingness to allow Anthemius to gain power amongst the imperial court. A more recent historian, Kenneth Holum, states that Anthemius had tried to make family ties between himself and the imperial family: “Married long since and many years Pulcheria’s senior, Anthemis naturally proposed a descendent or close relative, a grandson perhaps...born a few years earlier than Pulcheria and an excellent prospect for her hand”[14] Pulcheria had found herself in a position where she would have to give her power up to her potential husband, for once a woman in the imperial court married her power was to be relinquished to her husband. In order for Pulcheria to keep her power within the imperial court she took a vow of virginity to ensure that another man could not share her power.Augusta[edit]In 414 the Roman senate made Pulcheria Augusta. During her time as Augusta, Pulcheria held a great deal of power in politics and although she was a woman was treated equally among other men of power. In the senate of Constantinople lay a bust in her honor along with the other Augusti.[15] Many important events occurred during her time as Augusta and her brothers reign as emperor; however, Pulcheria’s influence was mostly in the church. Pulcheria and her brother were known to have harbored anti Jewish sentiment, and both had started to enact laws against Jewish worship in the city of Constantinople. Before the reign of Theodosius II, synagogues were seen as private property and were protected by the imperial government. In Theodosius’s reign he enacted a law that forbade the construction of synagogues, and demanded the destruction of synagogues as well. Pulcheria and Theodosius also ordered that a group of Jews be killed after strife amongst Christians emerged in Palestine.[16] It was well known that Pulcheria had little respect for Jewish people, stemmed by her disapproval of Nestorian theological practices; Kenneth Holum writes “Pulcheria had long nursed a special hatred for Jews, and the Nestorian heresy, which appeared to contemporaries to be of Jewish origin; no doubt had served to confirm that hatred.”[17] Although Pulcheria was known to have strong feelings against pagans and Jews alike, she was known for her philanthropic spirit as well. She had built many churches in and around the city of Constantinople, she had also built many buildings for the poor in the city Sozomen writes that it would take too much time to describe all the churches Pulcheria built, as well as hospitals and inns for the poor.[18] Pulcherias building projects were so vast in Constantinople that a whole district was named in her honor called the Pulcherianai, Some of these establishments were extensive enough to give the names of their proprietors to entire quarters of the city such as the Marina quarter in the second region and the Pulcherianai in the eleventh.[19] As well as contributing to the city with new churches and districts, Pulcheria contributed significantly to the church by bringing back bishops or remains of bishops who had once been dismissed as relics to the church. Pope Leo I describes Pulcherias contributions to the church in a letter to her, ...the entire Roman Church is most grateful to you for all the works of your faith, whether having assisted envoys in every way with devoted affection and for having brought back the Catholic bishops who were ejected from their churches by an unjust sentence, or for having brought back with fitting honor to the church he governed so well the remains of Flavian of holy memory, an innocent and Catholic bishop.[20] Pulcherias time as Augusta was also marked with war and ongoing conflict with Persia. Pulcheria had inspired war against Persia when Persian King Yazdegerd I executed a Christian bishop who destroyed an Zoroastrian altar.[21] Under the influence of Pulcheria, Theodosius sent troops into battle against Persia, the fanaticism over the war by the people of the empire was described by Sozomen as ready to do anything for the sake of Christianity.[21] Pulcheria and Theodosius were victorious in their invasion of Persia, and according to historians Theodosius had credited his sisters vow of virginity as the reason for victory. Surviving letters identify the source of that victory through the vows of his sisters. In his view, when Pulcheria devoted her virginity to God and imposed the same vow on her sisters, she secured Gods favor, causing every threat and war raised against her brother to disperse spontaneously.[22] Theodosius had made his sisters virginity a tool of war propaganda, and because of her vow to be faithful only to God the hand of God would help Roman troops in battle against Persia. Pulcherias power would become even greater after the death of her brother Theodosius II.Aelia Pulcheria (January 19, 398 or 399 – 453) was the daughter of Eastern Roman Emperor Arcadius and Empress Aelia Eudoxia. She was the second child born to Arcadius and Eudoxia. Her older sister was Flaccilla, who was born in 397 but is assumed to have died young. Her younger siblings were Arcadia, born in 400, Theodosius II, the future emperor, and Marina, both born in 401.[1] When her father Arcadius died in 408, her brother Theodosius II was made Emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire, at seven years old. On July 4, 414 a fifteen-year-old Pulcheria proclaimed herself regent over her brother, then thirteen years of age, and made herself Augusta and Empress of the Eastern Roman Empire. According to the ancient historian Sozomen, in his Ecclesiastical History, Pulcheria took a vow of virginity when she became Augusta, and her sisters followed suit. Theodosius II died on July 26, 450, and Pulcheria soon married Marcian on November 25, 450. Marcian and Pulcheria were proclaimed Emperor and Empress of the Eastern Roman Empire.

Theodosius II died on July 26, 450, and Pulcheria soon married Marcian on November 25, 450. Marcian and Pulcheria were proclaimed Emperor and Empress of the Eastern Roman Empire. Three years later, in July 453, Pulcheria died; she was later made a saint by the Church.[2] Pulcheria is known to have held a significant amount of power in her brothers reign as emperor. Pulcheria was also of great influence over the church and theological practices of this time. She had influence over anti-pagan policies, church building projects, and the debate over the Marian title Theotokos (Birth-giver to God).Contents  [hide] 1 Biography1.1 Early life1.2 The Emperors Guardian1.3 Vow of virginity1.4 Augusta1.5 Empress1.5.1 Church conflict1.6 Death2 Relationship with Aelia Eudocia3 Influence over the church4 See also5 Notes6 ReferencesBiography[edit]Early life[edit]Pulcheria was born into the royal House of Theodosius, a dynasty of the later Roman empire, ruling in Constantinople. Her father was Arcadius, and her mother was Aelia Eudoxia. Like Pulcheria, her mother was also powerful and of great influence over the church, however not in the same way Pulcheria was. Arcadius reign was marked by the conflict between his wife and the Bishop of Constantinople,“Although his reign (Arcadius) was short, it is remembered in part for the controversial conflicts Eudoxia encountered with John Chrysostom, bishop of Constantinople from 398 to 404.[3] According to the ancient historian Sozomen, in his Ecclesiastical History, Sozomen claims that much of the rivalry was based on an ornate statue made in the honor of Eudoxia which Chrysostom condemned, “The silver statue of the empress...was placed upon a column of porphyry; and the event was celebrated by loud acclamations, dancing, games, and other manifestations of public rejoicing...John declared that these proceedings reflected dishonor on the church.”[4] According to Sozomen, John had also condemned the empress for her grandiose style of ruling over the empire and condemned her in the church, this of course enraged the empress and John was immediately disposed of. Later in life, Pulcheria would bring back the remains of John Chrysostom and make them into relics for the church, in gratitude for his pious life.[5] Eudoxia died in 404 and the emperor Arcadius died in 408. The emperor left behind four young children, including a seven-year-old Theodosius II. Theodosius was made emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire in 408, immediately after his father died. Two praetorian prefects were selected as regents over Theodosius, one being Anthemius and the other, Antiochus; both took over as regent. Eventually Pulcheria herself would take over as regent for her brother.The Emperors Guardian[edit]Once Pulcheria came of age, at fifteen, she felt, like her brother, that her family had no need for Antiochus any longer; her brother dismissed him of his duties. She then became her own brother’s regent: “In 412 Pulcheria quarreled with Antiochus, who like Anthemius had served the dynasty faithfully for a number of years, and induced her brother to dismiss him from the duties of praepositus. She then took personal charge of the imperial family, directing its affairs with such authority that she became known in society at large as the emperor’s guardian.”[6] Immediately when Pulcheria took authority over the imperial palace, the palace took on a much more monastic tone compared to that of her mother’s palace. Sozomen describes Pulcheria’s and her sisters pious ways in his Ecclesiastical History: “They all pursue the same mode of life; they are sedulous in their attendance in the house of prayer, and evince great charity towards strangers and the poor...and pass their days and their nights together in singing the praises of God.”[7] Rituals within the imperial palace also included chanting and reciting passages in the scripture, and fasting twice a week.[6] The sisters were known to have given up luxurious jewelry and apparel worn by most women of the imperial court of the past. Pulcheria also took on the role of providing all the training necessary for Theodosius to become a successful emperor, once he came of age. Although the empire was technically to be ruled by Theodosius II when he would come of age, his older sister Pulcheria exercised such profound influence over him all his life that she must be considered the co-regent of the empire until her death in 453. In fact it can be said without exaggeration that Pulcheria gave the identity to her brothers reign.[8] Pulcherias training of Theodosius included, ...how an Emperor must walk, and ride his horse, alone or in procession; how he should sit upon his throne: how to wear his Imperial armor and robes; and how to speak with dignity. By no means must he yield to loud laughter...[9] Not only did Pulcheria train her brother on the duties and customs of becoming an Emperor, but she also made sure Theodosius was trained to be a pious Christian leader. Once Theodosius came of age to rule as sole Emperor, according to many historians, the teachings of his sister had been ignored. “He was by nature kind, affable, easily led...Not only was he foolishly kind; he was careless, and often he was to neglect his duty in the administration of his Empire.”[10] This lack of power that Theodosius exemplified led to Pulcheria taking on a much larger role of authority and influence in the Empire.Vow of virginity[edit]At the same time Pulcheria proclaimed herself as guardian over her brother she also took a vow of virginity, and her sisters did as well. Pulcheria’s reason for a vow of virginity may have been her deeply religious virtue as recorded by Sozomen: “She devoted her virginity to God, and instructed her sisters to do likewise. To avoid cause of scandal and opportunities for intrigue, she permitted no man to enter her palace. In confirmation of her resolution she took God, the priests, and all the subjects of the Roman empire as witnesses...”[11] Another contemporary of Pulcheria had also described her deep piety. In a letter from Pope Leo I to Pulcheria, he compliments her on her deeply religious ways: In it you clearly show how much you love the Catholic faith and how much you despise the errors of heretics.[12] Along with being deeply pious, it is possible that Pulcheria may have had other motives to take a vow of virginity. According to ancient historians Sozomen, Socrates, and Theodoret, Pulcheria had a deep dislike for Anthemius, the former guardian of Theodosius;[13] the reasons may have been his distaste for her immense power within the empire and her unwillingness to allow Anthemius to gain power amongst the imperial court. A more recent historian, Kenneth Holum, states that Anthemius had tried to make family ties between himself and the imperial family: “Married long since and many years Pulcheria’s senior, Anthemis naturally proposed a descendent or close relative, a grandson perhaps...born a few years earlier than Pulcheria and an excellent prospect for her hand”[14] Pulcheria had found herself in a position where she would have to give her power up to her potential husband, for once a woman in the imperial court married her power was to be relinquished to her husband. In order for Pulcheria to keep her power within the imperial court she took a vow of virginity to ensure that another man could not share her power.Augusta[edit]In 414 the Roman senate made Pulcheria Augusta. During her time as Augusta, Pulcheria held a great deal of power in politics and although she was a woman was treated equally among other men of power. In the senate of Constantinople lay a bust in her honor along with the other Augusti.[15] Many important events occurred during her time as Augusta and her brothers reign as emperor; however, Pulcheria’s influence was mostly in the church. Pulcheria and her brother were known to have harbored anti Jewish sentiment, and both had started to enact laws against Jewish worship in the city of Constantinople. Before the reign of Theodosius II, synagogues were seen as private property and were protected by the imperial government. In Theodosius’s reign he enacted a law that forbade the construction of synagogues, and demanded the destruction of synagogues as well. Pulcheria and Theodosius also ordered that a group of Jews be killed after strife amongst Christians emerged in Palestine.[16] It was well known that Pulcheria had little respect for Jewish people, stemmed by her disapproval of Nestorian theological practices; Kenneth Holum writes “Pulcheria had long nursed a special hatred for Jews, and the Nestorian heresy, which appeared to contemporaries to be of Jewish origin; no doubt had served to confirm that hatred.”[17] Although Pulcheria was known to have strong feelings against pagans and Jews alike, she was known for her philanthropic spirit as well. She had built many churches in and around the city of Constantinople, she had also built many buildings for the poor in the city Sozomen writes that it would take too much time to describe all the churches Pulcheria built, as well as hospitals and inns for the poor.[18] Pulcherias building projects were so vast in Constantinople that a whole district was named in her honor called the Pulcherianai, Some of these establishments were extensive enough to give the names of their proprietors to entire quarters of the city such as the Marina quarter in the second region and the Pulcherianai in the eleventh.[19] As well as contributing to the city with new churches and districts, Pulcheria contributed significantly to the church by bringing back bishops or remains of bishops who had once been dismissed as relics to the church. Pope Leo I describes Pulcherias contributions to the church in a letter to her, ...the entire Roman Church is most grateful to you for all the works of your faith, whether having assisted envoys in every way with devoted affection and for having brought back the Catholic bishops who were ejected from their churches by an unjust sentence, or for having brought back with fitting honor to the church he governed so well the remains of Flavian of holy memory, an innocent and Catholic bishop.[20] Pulcherias time as Augusta was also marked with war and ongoing conflict with Persia. Pulcheria had inspired war against Persia when Persian King Yazdegerd I executed a Christian bishop who destroyed an Zoroastrian altar.[21] Under the influence of Pulcheria, Theodosius sent troops into battle against Persia, the fanaticism over the war by the people of the empire was described by Sozomen as ready to do anything for the sake of Christianity.[21] Pulcheria and Theodosius were victorious in their invasion of Persia, and according to historians Theodosius had credited his sisters vow of virginity as the reason for victory. Surviving letters identify the source of that victory through the vows of his sisters. In his view, when Pulcheria devoted her virginity to God and imposed the same vow on her sisters, she secured Gods favor, causing every threat and war raised against her brother to disperse spontaneously.[22] Theodosius had made his sisters virginity a tool of war propaganda, and because of her vow to be faithful only to God the hand of God would help Roman troops in battle against Persia. Pulcherias power would become even greater after the death of her brother Theodosius II."}
